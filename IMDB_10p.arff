'in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen\'t see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis\'s direction also helps , and although he dosen\'t try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren\'t bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there\'s not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n',pos
' \" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n',pos
'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a \" colored \" person and his friends , the \" non-colored \" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n',pos
'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\'s memoir angela\'s ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\'m important ! \" \nmccourt\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn\'t sound like much of a plot . \nthat\'s probably because it isn\'t one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\'t like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\'s superb poster . \nit is breen\'s first feature film and he\'s extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\'s soul through breen\'s sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven\'t read the book , but i\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\'m suspicious . \nanother thing that\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\'s ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n',pos
'now that \" boogie nights \" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn\'t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . \nthe latest art house interpretation is whit stillman\'s \" the last days of disco . \" \nstillman , who made \" metropolitan \" and \" barcelona \" using some of the same actors , uses disco\'s final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . \nthe young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don\'t call them yuppies ! ) \nmen and women of \" the last days of disco \" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . \nhere they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . \nif talk is cheap , \" the last days of disco \" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . \nwhat makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of \" the lady and the tramp \" ) . \nna ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . \ncharlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , \" like a kindergarten teacher . \" \nthe two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . \nhere they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . \ndes ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club\'s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . \ndes has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he\'s gay . \nwhether it\'s true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . \ncharlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . \njimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of \" barcelona \" ? ) . \njosh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , \" book this clown ! \" \nand robert sean leonard plays another one of alice\'s revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . \nany film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . \nin fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . \nwhile the eschewing of \" ferocious pairing \" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the \" preferred \" dynamics of social group interaction . \nmore mature than stillman\'s previous two films , \" the last days of disco \" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . \nit\'s a movie you should definitely get on down to . \n',pos
'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \ni can\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \n \" shine \" was one bookend . \nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \nbryan | brown . \nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man\'s justice \" to the aboriginals . \nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \nan eye for an eye . \nrevenge . \nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\'s thigh . \nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \nhe admits that he has to \'bend the rules\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \nshe appears to not know this . \ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\'s payback time . \nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \neveryone is affected in the fall out . \nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \nsuffice to say it\'s a rewarding experience . \nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \'invaders\' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \nin a year when the race \'debate\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \n',pos
'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\'t ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit\'s got some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit\'s pretty obvious the film\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n',pos

'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\'t . \ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \nthis is the first star wars film i\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \nbasically , the film\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\'s ship . \nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \nwhat a klutz ! \ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \ni can\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \nthe film is a treasure to look at . \nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8\% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \nnot since 1997\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\'s classic silent metropolis . \nhowever , all the sets are so original . \nthe original star wars movies can\'t even match the grandeur of this film\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \nwhether its queen amadala\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \nas for john williams\' score , i don\'t think he\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\'t even remember . \nit is as epic as his schindler\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \n',pos
'lisa cholodenko\'s \" high art , \" is an intelligent , quiet drama . \nits strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . \nthey are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . \njudging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers\' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . \nsyd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , \" frame . \" \nshe very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . \none night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . \nsyd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . \nlucy claims she doesn\'t want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the \" frame \" editors to do a piece on her work . \nall the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . \n \" high art , \" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd\'s luck begins to rise . \nthe film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . \nas lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . \nwith this picture , ally sheedy\'s star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . \nher characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can\'t help her , is heartbreaking . \nalthough not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy\'s footsteps to her role . \nalso very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , \" love and other catastrophes , \" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . \neasily being able to pass as christina ricci\'s older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . \nas accurate as almost every detail is in , \" high art , \" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . \nby the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . \nthis is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . \nalthough many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . \nthe character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the \" frame \" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . \nand the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . \nfor once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . \n \" high art , \" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy\'s strongest , and best , role to date . \n',pos
'the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster \nthe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . \nwhen those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . \nwhen the life is that of jeff \" the dude \" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of \" what\'sgoingonaroundhere \" . \nthe marvelous sound of \" the stranger \" ( sam elliot ) \'s voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he\'s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn\'t have much of a life , but he\'s having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . \nlebowski\'s passion is bowling . \nwhen he\'s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he\'s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn\'t have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . \nthe \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . \nthe next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake\'s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it\'s virtually the only object there . \nwhen he\'s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski\'s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton\'s favorites for a thousand bucks . \nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he\'s heading for the cash machine . \nlater he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny\'s kidnappers . \nthis begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . \nthe kidnappers are impossibly inept . \nthe dude and his cronies are even worse . \nevery plan goes awry . \nyou can almost see lebowski\'s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . \nthat\'s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn\'t much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude\'s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you\'d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they\'re not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . \nwhen a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won\'t admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . \ndonny gets precious few words in between walter\'s screaming and the dude\'s rambling . \nwhen he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . \ndonny is \" out of his league \" and doesn\'t \" have a frame of reference \" . \nthe film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . \nthe big lebowski\'s daughter maude , an avant-garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . \nthe kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . \nbunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . \nmost impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . \nas the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . \nthe camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . \nhe addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . \nhis tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . \nbridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . \ni can\'t think of anyone else who could have done a better job . \nbuscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . \nthe more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he\'s one of the treasures of our time . \nit\'s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr\'s television husband . \nmore like the coen\'s \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . \na mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . \nthere\'s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . \nwalking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . \non further examination , i wasn\'t sure exactly what it was . \n \" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it\'s not going to be what you expect \" ? \n \" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling \" ? \nmaybe there\'s no real message . \nperhaps it\'s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . \nmaybe that\'s enough . \n ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about \" the man in the iron mask \" starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages . \nredman@bvoice .

'i don\'t box with kid gloves . \ni don\'t play nice , i\'m not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber\'s manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers\' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . \' \nin down with america , the line `roswell\' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn\'t care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name\' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don\'t have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l\'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit\'s almost as much fun as the film . \n',pos
'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn\'t . \nit\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn\'t about the lack of these elements . \nit\'s about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\'s needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn\'t the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\'t even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\'s head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn\'t that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn\'t that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\'s acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don\'t even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the

'a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark\'s migration from the \" good vibrations \" and \" calvin klein undie ad \" guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . \nplot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . \nboy likes girl . \ngirl likes boy . \nboy and girl begin dating . \nparents of girl aren\'t crazy about the boy . \ngirl steps to boy\'s defense . \nfamily problems occur . \ngirl learns more about the boy . \nboy goes nuts . \nfun ensues . \ncritique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? \nwell , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . \nit isn\'t the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . \ni think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as \" best villain \" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . \nthe soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if \nyou\'re into that kind of thing , that is : ) . \ni didn\'t much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . \nthen again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the \" big deal \" was about his daughter dating david . \nhis reply : \" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . \" \ngood point . \nall in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent\'s worst nightmare . \nmind you , i still can\'t tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . \nand on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! \nanother firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! \nlittle known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . \nmark wahlberg stands 5 \" 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . \nhis brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . \nhe is also testing the waters on the acting front . \n',pos
'wow ! what a movie . \nit\'s everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich\'s mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich\'s mind , she doesn\'t believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don\'t know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world\'s most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz\'s appearence to john malkovich\'s explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn\'t a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i\'ve seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn\'t want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don\'t . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n\'being john malkovich\' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend \'being john malkovich\' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n',pos

'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \nwashington provides much of the film\'s intensity and emotional power . \nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \nit makes your blood boil . \nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\'s close childhood friends . \nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \nunfortunately , however , broderick\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \nthe film places too much weight on broderick\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \na couple of the movie\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \nthe regiment\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \n',pos
'steven spielberg\'s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \nspielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \nhe also managed to cast this era\'s greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \nfor about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \nliterally . \nthe plot is simple enough . \nafter the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \njames ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \nonce they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \naccompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \nbarry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \nthe battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \nliterally . \nthere is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film\'s first 20 minutes . \nspielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \nthe sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \nthere are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \nthis is what coppola was looking for in \" apocalypse now \" , but couldn\'t create . \nthe sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \nthe performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \nhe is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \nhanks is this country\'s finest actor , and he proves it here . \nhowever , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \nwith a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \nthe sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn\'t hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \nbut that is forgivable . \nwhat isn\'t is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \nthe first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \nthe last sequence is atrocious . \nthe forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \nthese flaws are what downgrade \" ryan \" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \nspielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \nthe use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie\'s theme . \nthe power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \nspielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . \nthis is the film of the year . \n',pos
'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\'s character in this film . \npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv\'s world , the world where our protagonist lives . \ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \ntruman leads the perfect life . \nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \n . \n . \nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \ntruman is really suspicious now . \nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \n \" it\'s best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman\'s memory . \ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \nyou know by now that truman\'s life is the subject of a television program . \nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \nit\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\' point of view . \nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\'t think the film itself asked them . \nit certainly didn\'t address them or try to answer them . \ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\'s life is a tv show . \ncarrey\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\'s pacing . \nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\'t see it that way . \nperhaps it\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \nphilip glass\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \nthere\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \nit\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\'s end . \nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\'s gattaca . \nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\'s next film , whatever it may be . \n',pos
