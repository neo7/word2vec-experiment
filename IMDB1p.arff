'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat\'s the deal ? \nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\'t snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it\'s simply too jumbled . \nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\'s going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\'s biggest problem . \nit\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don\'t know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\'s unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn\'t stick because it doesn\'t entertain , it\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\'s \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) \n',neg
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \ndamn that y2k bug . \nit\'s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \nlittle do they know the power within . . . \ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \nwe don\'t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don\'t know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don\'t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \nhere , it\'s just \" hey , let\'s chase these people around with some robots \" . \nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \nyou\'re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he\'s acting like a baldwin , of course . \nthe real star here are stan winston\'s robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone\'s brain . \nso , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here\'s your movie . \notherwise , it\'s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \n',neg
'it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . \nbased on the late 1960\'s television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \nhowever , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane\'s nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn\'t enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn\'t really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we\'ve already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he\'s not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don\'t do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american \'r\' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won\'t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you\'ll know they aren\'t . \nbasing the show on a 1960\'s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that\'s missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we\'ve been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n',neg
' \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros . \' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney\'s cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall\'s promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney\'s \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997\'s best piece of animation . \nthis year , it\'s no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that\'d be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn\'t nearly as dull as this . \nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur\'s round table . \nkayley\'s only dream is to follow in her father\'s footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur\'s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that\'s always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur\'s side . \n \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it\'s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \nthere\'s nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you\'d see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n ( compare kayley and garrett\'s run-in with the angry ogre to herc\'s battle with the hydra . \ni rest my case . ) \neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \nin the end , it\'s a tie -- they all win . \nthat dragon\'s comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \nat least fans of the early-\'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i\'m at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don\'t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" \'s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n',neg
'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\'s intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n',neg
'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n',neg
'so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \ni\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \ni\'m talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \nprobably not . \nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \nthen , as it\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \nand just when you think it\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \ntrust me . \nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \nnicolas \' \" snake eyes \" \' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\'s safe documents a young girl\'s murder . \nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\'s \" hardcore . \" \noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \n \" 8mm \" doesn\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \nlater it\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\'s quite good and by far the film\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \n',neg
'that\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \nthere weren\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \nit\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \nit\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\'s head in joan cusack\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\'s pregnant girlfriend she has \" a big pussy , \" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \nwhy a child psychologist ? \nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \nkid : my dad\'s an asshole . \ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \nkid : my dad\'s a _huge_ asshole . \nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\'s equally annoying friend\'s wife is also pregnant . \nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \nthat\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line \" now it\'s time to take a look at your volvo , \" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \nhugh grant\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\'s nervous smiles . \neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \nbut at least they didn\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \n',neg
'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\'t for kaisa\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\'t fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain\'t they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn\'t know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\'s captivating signs & wonders . \nit\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n',neg

'best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann\'s forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he\'s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach\'s hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe\'s an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids\' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe\'ll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe\'s both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn\'t want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he\'s a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie\'s ill-advised foray into big john\'s haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie\'s miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe\'re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it\'s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . \'s screenplay doesn\'t always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach\'s goldberg variations . \nit\'s too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john\'s other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff\'s superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit\'s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n',neg
'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n',neg
'and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn\'t pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas\'s the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd\'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu\'s man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer\'s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king\'s prison . \nd\'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d\'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it\'s a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li\'s high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers\' d\'artangnan isn\'t a musketeer -- he\'s a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam\'s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that\'s the only standout in an overall flat production . \n',neg
'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn\'t i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\'t try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and

'john carpenter makes b-movies . \nalways has ( \" halloween , \" \" escape from new york , \" \" the thing \" ) and , by the looks of it ( \" they live , \" \" escape from l . a . , \" \" vampires \" ) , always will . \ncarpenter\'s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled \" john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars \" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else\'s \" ghosts of mars \" ) . \nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive \" john carpenter\'s , \" \" ghosts of mars \" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- \" species \" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james \" desolation \" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named \" desolation \" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn\'t need to try too hard . \nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird\'s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn\'t waste any of the film\'s budget in that department . \n \" ghosts of mars \" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \ncarpenter might like to think he\'s made a western here but it\'s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \nit\'s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \ni never thought i\'d miss the guy but i do . \nit\'s not * all * the same , however . \ndubbed the \" one-note wonder \" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet \" ( with val kilmer ) . \n \" ghosts of mars \" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them \" american pie 2 \" and \" rush hour 2 \" ) . \nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter\'s film feels sadly absent . \nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth\'s closest neighbor . \ntwo things keep \" john carpenter\'s ghosts of mars \" from getting a huge slap upside the head . \n1 . \nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn\'t pretend to be anything it\'s not . \nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \n',neg
'i\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\'m the only one who doesn\'t like it . \none girl said if i\'d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\'t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in\' movie i\'ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\'s too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\'s taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can\'t call it a sex flick . \ni\'ve already pointed out that it can\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n',neg
'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\'re left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit\'s like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\'s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \nbut it isn\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell , i don\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin\' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\'t saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n\'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere\'s a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n',neg
'the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film\'s end . \nif you\'re not familiar with this law , then maybe you\'ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film\'s end . \nnow if you\'re a regular reader of mine , you\'ve heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? \nno , it definitely is not . \nmelissa joan hart ( from abc\'s \" sabrina , the teenage witch \" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who\'s just broken up with his activist girlfriend . \napparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . \nso the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \nwill this crazy scheme work ? \ndo i care ? \nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \nwhat makes movies like can\'t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she\'s all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \ni don\'t know what the writer\'s intention was with drive me crazy . \nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \nhere there\'s nothing . . . \njust teens whining about who\'s going to take them to the big dance . \ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \njust shut the hell up . \nin all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . \nnow normally when i say that it\'s followed with the joke \" . . . because the movie is finally over . \" \nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears\' titular song , there\'s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \nnothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries \" v \" and \" v : the final battle \" ) . \n[pg-13] \n',neg
'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \nthat\'s some ape . \" \njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \nhe breaks things on accident , because he\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \nas a character , he doesn\'t quite register . \nand the story he\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \nit\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \nspecifically , she\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \nsoon , zoologist gregg o\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\'s mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\'s mother . \njill , of course , doesn\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\'t any characters , and the film isn\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\'t happy ! \" \nand \" joe isn\'t safe here ! \" \n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \ni don\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\'re close . \nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \nit\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \nbut adults in the audience aren\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \n',neg
