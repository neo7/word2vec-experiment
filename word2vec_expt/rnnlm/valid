it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one .  i continued to watch ,  every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously .  well ,  as seriously as this genre requests .   the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clichéd .  if a film was made in 1920  ( for example )  and had the quality of hide & seek  ( cord )  in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive .  as it happens ,  this film was made in 2000 and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one .   definitely not for the serious movie-goer .   [not worth a rating]
there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death .  the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better .  this truly was a horror film .  i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that i will never get back .  the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss .  please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them . 
there is an interesting discussion in this movie .  is being a moral person good enough ,  or do you need something more ?   the movie preaches that without the guidance of god ,  being a morally good person is not enough .  there is a line early in the movie ,   " you and i can look at a person who is morally good ,  but both know he is going to go to hell .  "   while i am not a christian ,  the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating ,  but not in the way the movie intended .  i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good *is* enough .  the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased ,  so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance .  fanaticism can be a powerful thing ,  especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated .  as george carlin's character in dogma said :   " hook em while they're young "  .   the basic premise is a very interesting one also .  a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok ,  as long as the morality is meaningful .  do you only tell a child not to steal ?  or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to ?   ( not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because ,  well ,  how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen ?  )   the author ,  carlisle ,  wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book  ( to spread the world )  .  however ,  it needs unanimous consent ,  and one of the scholars opposes it .  he brings up ,  in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality's sake vs god's words argument .  to prove his point ,  he produces a time machine  ( put in the movie solely to make the plot work ,  which i'm fine with )  ,  and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead us .   as should be obvious ,  he has his opinion ,  and is changed by what he sees ,  and has reversed himself by the time of his return  ( for he does return ,  that's not really a spoiler ,  this is a bible movie after all )  .   as for the movie as a movie itself ,  it's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted .  something that was *not* needed in this movie ,  is that it produces two  " bad guys "  who want to try to figure out who carlisle is ,  even tho he hasn't hurt anyone ,  committed a crime ,  or anything .  what's wrong with the movie just showing carlisle's opinion ,  showing his view of this  " sinful world "  ,  and returning him with a new viewpoint ?    also ,  there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that i'm happy i'm not a christian ,  or at least someone who says  " it's god or nothing "  .  three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me .  .  first ,  when the two  " bad guys "  corner carlisle right before he jumps ,  carlisle does his *only* truly despicable act .  .  he fakes like his time-jump is the coming of jesus ,  and makes it so the  " bad guys "   ( who are also christians btw ,  oddly enough )  ,  think they just missed the rapture .    secondly ,  after carlisle returns ,  he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing  ( but not mentioning god ,  kid kept the marbles and ran away )  ,  and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it .  like the carlin quote above ,  scaring kids into religion is a faux-pas in my book .   and lastly ,  the epilogue .  another scare tactic .  carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go ,  and he says he doesn't know .  .  the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future  ( starts at 2100 )  ,  and it fails .  .  he keeps decrementing the years by 10 ,  and trying again ,  and by the fade-out ,  he's at like 2030 or so .  throughout the movie ,  carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming ,  because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god .  .  scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years .  .  you would think in these enlightened times ,  the church would have enlightened as well .   i'm glad i saw this movie .  while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough ,  now i know it for a fact .  worth watching if you are not a christian ,  to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie . 
not being familiar with us television stations ,  when i flicked onto this on my in-laws' cable ,  first i thought it was just a low-budget sci-fi film ,  then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist ,  and then it dawned on me - good grief ,  these people are serious !  it's been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious .  i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers ,  but then i saw other reviews and thought ,  hey ,  they can take it .  tough philosophical conundrum :  how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you're criticizing ?  answer :  make it in such a way that the only people who'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're criticizing .  i suppose some liberals  ( ugh !  spit when you say that !  )  might be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the j**** c***** myth ,  but i didn't mind - it was so darn funny ! 
this movie seems to send the wrong message .  there can be morality without using christ .  poeple of other religions ,  i believe ,  can get into heaven .  i am a catholic who goes to church every week ,  but i do not agree with such christian arrogance .  this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen timeline . 
i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma ,  but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will ,  rational thinking ,  the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke !   there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens .   i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by  " reefer madness .  "  that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach  " christian "  principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world .   it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century ! 
first of all ,  this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school .  that's not a good thing .  basically ,  it's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth ,  just like the terrible  " left behind "  series .  i'm not offended by religious movies .  .  .  but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful .  i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon .  i bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget ,  they still wouldn't be able to come up with anything good .  just avoid this one .  also ,  the fact that the  " american family association "   ( basically ,  reverend wildmon's lackies )  beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it .  in fact ,  after i viewed this ,  i went home and watched my copy of david cronenberg's nc-17 rated  " crash "  .  forgive me father for i have sinned .  hahahahaha ! 
i rented this by mistake .  i thought ,  after a cursory examination of the box ,  that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story .  instead ,  it's a  " christian "  story ,  and i suppose is fairly typical example .  if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc .  ,  but i found it rather painful .    i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story .  it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality  ( a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce !  )  ,  but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this  " highly moral "  society  ( rigid racial ,  sexual ,  and social discrimination were widespread ,  for instance )  .  and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles  ( as reported in a recent wsj )  .   overall ,  thought ,  i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing ,  and it's certainly wholesome .  .  . 
the premise sucked me in ,  but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible .  interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list .  i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece  ( romero comes to mind )  ,  but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one .  the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80  ( or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya ?  )  and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming .  it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings  ( i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc )  .  i like to think that god is a little greater than that . 
the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor .  a visual treat to the eye ,  the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart .  i was intrigued ,  at first ,  by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to  " find "  their capacity for love .  what follows is a huge disappointment .  boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment .  dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask .  as a monk ,  boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer  ( which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse )  -- when he leaves his  " marriage to god "  the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion .  the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past .  however ,  the journey that follows is all too predictable . 
i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian .  i am not .  if you are looking for a christian movie ,  i recommend this film .  if you are looking for a good general movie ,  i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere .   i was annoyed by the characters ,  and their illogical behaviour .  the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong .  one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal ,  and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this .  i find that offensive :  are we to believe that  " thou shalt not steal "  came from jesus ?  i suppose he wrote the ten commandments ?  and stealing was acceptable before that ?  i rented the movie from netflix .  i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments .  oh well . 
i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it ,  for while it is suppose to have a  " good "  message ;  the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture .  an interpretation ,  in my opinion ,  will mislead a lot of people .  in addition ,  i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable .  never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie .  so ,  if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority ,  then by all means ,  get this film .  this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi ,  because the title will deceive a lot of people as well .  this was an unfortunate film ,  because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered .  the film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the  " time machine "  probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future . 
i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that .  the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn't expect a fundamentalist christian film !   the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being .  our hero ,  who is a bible professor from the 1890s ,  eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - jesus is nowhere to be found .  this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg-wells-style time machine .  the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point ,  which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film .  earlier  ( or perhaps immediately later ,  can't remember for certain )  ,  our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says .  what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about ,  however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful .   in any case ,  that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time .  so ,  if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors ,  then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as i don't think there's any evidence  ( and none was offered )  for the physics of time travel in the bible .  so immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there ,  but never mind .  .  .   after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future ,  the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases .  it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year  ( as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself ,  a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date :  it's just two thousand and .  .  .  *honk* )  .  some of the shock went on a little too long ,  though .  for instance ,  the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van .  he sticks his head out the window like a dog might ,  is scared by the headlights and the starting engine ,  etc .  that seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic .  in any case ,  that's easy to ignore .  the rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote .   unfortunately ,  our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder .  eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful ,  but mostly was just more of the same .  a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy  ( go figure )  and investigate his name .  they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is .  the movie frames these guys as non-believer bad guys for being skeptical .   just before the professor is to head back to his own time ,  he is confronted by those two men .  in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away ,  he eventually breaks into an almost insane-like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him .  just in time ,  he's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about .   the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self-proclaimed  ( and most likely false )  prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god-given knowledge  ( that was stated or even hinted at )  .   as i understand it ,  revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying  ( and failing )  to send a bible into the future .  first 2080 ,  then 2070 ,  etc .  as the scene fades out .  clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he shouldn't be able to know !  essentially ,  the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only ,  it means there couldn't ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know !  the entire movie's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it's own credibility in the end . 
falsely accused ,  skirt-chasing chums john wayne  ( as john scott )  and eddy chandler  ( as kansas charlie )  change identities to become  " alias smith and jones "  .  mr .  wayne becomes  " john jones "  .  mr .  chandler's is supposed to be  " rev .  smith "  ,  but wayne calls him  " dr .  smith "  .  at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis ,  pete duel ,  jonathan harris ,  or ben murphy ;  although ,  wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them ,  career wise .  pretty blonde mary kornman  ( as anne )  ,  grown-up from her days in  " our gang "  ,  is a lovely interest for wayne .  she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne .  if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s ,  this movie won't make you one . 
one of the more 'literate' lone stars ,  with time spent on character development and interaction ,  dialog and acting business .  the opening scene sets the stage  ( literally )  for the personalities of the gambler ,  kansas charlie  ( eddy chandler )  ,  and his buddy ,  john scott  ( john wayne )  the rodeo  ( say roh-day-oh )  star ,  both of whom are slightly randy .  the film follows their adventures ,  as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita ,  and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman ,  who has the inevitable evil brother  ( though he'd been led astray by the real villain ,  and wants to repent )  .  and oh ,  of course ,  they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end .   the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary's butt in her grocery store ,  and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls .  it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western ,  but it sounds better than it actually is .    sadly ,  the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here .  no yakima canutt .  cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses .  no george hayes .  tedious stooge-like bi-play between scott and charlie ,  with charlie swinging at scott ,  scott stomping on his foot and then punching him  ( repeated two more times !  )  .  the skilled paul fix is underused .  eddy chandler himself ,  here in his big star turn ,  is not really believable as a randy side kick .  the villain looks too old and fat .  so does chandler ,  who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf .  mary kornman ,  of the twenties  " our gang "   ( see 'mary ,  queen of tots' 1925 )  is cute in her scenes with john wayne ,  but that's about it for this one .  seeds of a better western lie buried here .   p . s .  the ultra-short colorized version ,  which looks good ,  moves along so fast ,  it's over if you blink more than once .  thankfully though ,  the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut . 
before i explain the  " alias "  comment let me say that  " the desert trail "  is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges .  in fact it features carmen laroux as semi- bad girl juanita ,  when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short  " saved by the belle "  .    in  " the desert trail "  john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard .  like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is moe hitting curly .  wayne's character ,  a skirt chasing bully ,  is not very endearing ,  but is supposed to be the good guy .    playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar  ( actually even less after wayne robs the box office )  .  no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl .    things get complicated at this point because the villain  ( al ferguson )  and his sidekick larry fine  ( played by paul fix-who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's  " the rifleman "  )  see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager .  moe and curly get blamed .    so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones .  who do they meet first but their old friend larry ,  whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest  ( senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie )  .    larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman  ( now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's  " our gang "  shorts )  .  kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production ,  as if they used an entirely different crew to film them .    even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad .  the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse .  both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground ,  but there is no horse in the frame ,  the film stock is completely different ,  and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider .  there is liberal use of stock footage in other places ,  none of it even remotely convincing .    one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away  ( to screen right )  from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left .  the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse .  outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this ,  not because it is looks stupid  ( which it does )  but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner .  they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action .  or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background .    then again ,  what do i know ?  i'm only a child . 
john scott  ( john wayne )  and partner kansas charlie  ( eddy chandler )  are trail buddies who make their way to the rattlesnake gulch rodeo .  scott is a pretty fair contestant ,  but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter ,  he'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint .  quite coincidentally ,  bandits pete  ( al ferguson )  and jim  ( paul fix )  decide they'd like the rest of the rodeo take ;  they shoot promoter farnsworth  ( henry hall )  ,  and make it look like scott and kansas charlie are the killers .    wayne and chandler use a running gag in the film where they're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities .  each time chandler takes a wild swing ,  wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly .   if you're very attentive ,  there's a neat lipton's tea ad in one of the scenes in which scott's love interest anne  ( mary kornman )  appears .   later on in the film ,  the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery .  having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways ,  bad guy jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff ,  but pete shoots him down .  while being patched up ,  jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister anne .  in an unbelievable scene ,  anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff .    " the desert trail "  is one of the blander john wayne westerns from lone star productions during this era .  noticeably absent are george  " gabby "  hayes and yakima canutt ,  one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters .  if you're a john wayne fan though ,  you'll have to see it once ,  but that will probably be enough . 
this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time .  for one ,  it has his old friend paul fix in it ;  fix ,  being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain ,  brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters .  the plot ,  about mistaken identity ,  payroll robbery and murder ,  is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western ,  but wayne's strapping good looks ,  easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable .  plump ,  balding eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's womanizing  " partner "  ,  and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome .  on the other hand ,  wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman ,  the little  " mary "  of the early  " little rascals "  fame .  she is a grown-up 20-year-old now ,  blonde and cute as a button .  most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star/monogram  " b's "  were fairly bland and colorless ,  but mary is perky ,  cute and ,  yes ,  sexy .  there's a scene in the general store ,  where she works ,  in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of  " nerve tonic "  ,  which happens to be on the top shelf ,  so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf .  wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps ,  then again as she comes down ,  then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 .  wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt .  anyway ,  it's an interesting little  " b "  ,  not great ,  but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time .  the final gunfight isn't handled all that well ,  and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while ,  but all in all ,  it's worth a look ,  if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman . 
this movie is horrendous .  decent fight scenes or not ,  the acting is really bad ,  like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card .  with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast .  think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions  ( weird pauses between different character's lines ,  combined with hurried line delivery by others )  .  if the movie were all action ,  this might be forgivable ,  but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and family guy style ,  irreverent cut aways  ( oh ,  wow ,  are they badly done )  .  i'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these ,  but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip .    now to the fight scenes .  they're not too bad ,  considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film .  nothing great either ,  certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated  ( nothing like drunken master )  .  the fights have an overly staged feel ,  with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved .    in sum ,  the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very ,  very cheap production .  which guy you may ask ?  oh ,  the same guy who wrote ,  directed ,  produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece . 
the beginning of this movie was good .  it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself .  i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie .  they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy .  how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day .  a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it .  how can so many people have little respect for other people ?  i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie .  there were some good parts to this movie also .  some people might like it ,  but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone . 
when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers ,  it was films like the garden of allah .  how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me .  also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me .   the garden of allah ,  one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12 .  it then got two silent screen adaptions .  the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world .  he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent .  she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train .   the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer .  i'm not sure what was in david o .  selznick's mind in filming this story .  someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience .  but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title .  the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting .   as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret .  the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves .  the monks are a sincerely pious group ,  but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest .   anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts .  most especially marlene dietrich .  i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot . 
quirky ,  independent ,  theatrical ,  christian slater--these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so  " discovering "  a jewel of a film .  boy ,  was i disappointed .  julian po never gets over itself .  the film is relentlessly self-conscious .  i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment .  the overdone ,  obviously theatrical sets ,  the overdone ,  obviously theatrical acting ,  the overdone ,  obviously theatrical directing -- well ,  you get the idea .    allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style .  and it's hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him .  the ridiculous girlfriend ,  the annoying townsfolk ,  the idiotic clergyman ,  the bratty kids -- why would anyone ,  particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside  ( slater's character )  ,  decide to stay in such a dismal place ? 
i really ,  really wanted to like julian po .  i think that slater is underrated as an actor ,  and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film .  i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read .  so ,  i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story ,  or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter .  the premise is wonderful ,  and i loved the voiceover ,  confessional tone the opening narration strikes .  but then .  .  .  ?  nothing !  several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide .  one could argue that he doesn't answer ,  because it's none of their business .  but julian is the one who ,  under only token pressure ,  blurted out his intentions in public .  then neither julian nor the director/writer ,  despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake ,  seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life .  he says he was a bookkeeper .  he says his family moved around when he was a child ,  due to his father's job .  so what ?  there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose .  but none of them go anywhere ,  because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet ,  as if he were the ultimate  ( and only )  sane one among them .  this might work as an allegory ,  if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart .  the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive ,  religious wife of the mechanic .  and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian .  i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish ,  petty ,  and totally condescending .  sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked ,  contrived film .  and poor michael parks ,  an actor who once had so much promise ,  is given nothing to work with here . 
seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen .  they stammer and pause and stammer some more .  only for really die-hard denero fans !  it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very ,  very low budget film made by college students .  the most often used word in the whole film is  " hum "  .  the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties/early seventies though .  if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other ,  horrible lighting  ( even if it is for  " art's sake "  )  ,  and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting ,  then you might like this - but you need to be really bored .  i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why . 
it is only robert de niro film which i really hates .  it is stupid film with horrible acting  ( of course not de niro )  .  for me ,  brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface  ( 1983 )  or the untouchables  ( 1987 )  .  i also loved de palma's mission :  impossible  ( 1996 )  .  de niro worked with palma two different times too ,  greetings and the wedding party .  i though that the wedding party was ok too  ( i didn't watch greetings )  .    screenplay is really bad and unfunny .  there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time .  film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a  " be black baby "  scene and also i don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared .  so ,  it is one of the worst film i have ever seen !  just worst .  i hate that . 
this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  i'm still not sure if it was serious ,  or just a satire .  one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of .  arrrrgh .   don johnson was pretty good in it actually .  but otherwise it sucked .  it was over 10 years ago that i saw it ,  but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain .    the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is .  i won't ruin it for you ,  should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie .  but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end ,  with a few in between .  if you have nothing better to do ,  and you like to point and laugh ,  then maybe it might be worth your while .  additionally ,  if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like ,  suggest watching this movie together ,  and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it .  that's a fair price to pay ,  i guess . 
 !  !  !  !  possible mild spoiler  !  !  !  !  !   as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge / joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s  .  it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse  "  is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney  ?   "   ,  but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a  "  lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client  "  type film which ends in a ridiculous manner  ,  and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect  .   this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men
you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it .  that would be a mistake .  this is one of the most pointless films ever made .  i kept waiting for something funny to happen ,  but nothing funny appears in this movie .  even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it .  its a wonder that it was ever put on video .   i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film .  i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films .  surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it ,  and a waste of anyone's time watching it .  surely there are high school students who would be able to write/produce a film which as a plot . 
peter sellers plays dick scratcher  ( ha , ha )  ,  a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one .  although he's witnessed a treasure being buried ,  he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank .  thus ,  dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts  ( do you place an ad for that ?  )  and help lead a path to the treasure .  it's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film .  former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director ,  and given medak's talents in the film the ruling class ,  you can probably guess which of the grainy ,  poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director's chair .  peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain .  he's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned ,  so that he can keep this off his resume .  franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate ,  with even sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible .  they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it .  with lines like these ,  i can understand any possible unease :   pierre :   ( about to be hanged )  you'll pay for this .   scratcher :  no ,  i won't .  i'll do it for free .   and that's one of the good jokes .  it's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults ,  but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago !  how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well-received british tv program  " a show called fred "  starring sellers ,  milligan ,  and directed by the great richard lester ? 
this movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals ,  and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywood's sugar-coating ,  which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film .  but some of the scenes go on for much too long  ( the wedding ,  especially )  ,  and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen .   the dialog was particularly distracting ,  and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on .  most of the characters were either italian-americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties ,  but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks .  toward the end i was laughing ,  and not because the filmmakers wanted me to .  i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian ,  and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk .  but it absolutely did not work for me .   another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason :  the main character's son ,  born and raised in new york in the 1920's ,  suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent .  i'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in england .   i give this movie an 'a' for effort and intention ,  but a considerably lower grade for execution . 
this is one of the worst films i have *ever* seen !  it is bad ,  even at tv movie level standards .  the plot is diabolically flawed ,  and the known names in this film are wasted on confused ,  uncertain characters .  i don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad .  billed as a 'psychological horror thriller' - it is certainly horrific .  there is nothing thrilling about it .  and it could do you psychological damage !  the initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain ,  but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief .  no matter how hard you try ,  you couldn't care less about the characters .  there are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from chinese philosophers ,  and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead !   i have purchased over 300 films on dvd ,  and this is the first one i'm going to get my money back on .  steer clear . 
this picture seemed way to slanted ,  it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq .  it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias .  also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd .  to me the subject matter seemed confused ,  it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light ,  as a )  an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b )  an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v . a .  this is a legitimate argument ,  but felt off topic for me ,  almost like a movie in and of itself .  i felt that  " the war tapes "  and  " blood of my brother "  were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint .  f-
i felt brain dead ,  i'll tell you .  this is the worst film i have ever bought .   ( in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name )  .  the performances are so terrible they are laughable .  the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire .  the script promotes that kind of tv movie ,  stare into the middle distance kind of acting .  the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani ,  they have one look each ,  and stick to it .  plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this .  the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes .  avoid like a plague . 
even worse than the worst david lynch  " confusathon "  ,   " brain dead "  makes no sense whatsoever .  shamefully wasted talent  ( bill pullman ,  bill paxton )  ,  bounce around like they are in a  " tom and jerry "  cartoon on acid .  there is negligible character development .  it simply starts climbing the  " strange scale "  ,  until climaxing in total chaos .  do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors .  they are given nothing to work with ,  and you will be wondering what's going on throughout the entire ,  unbearable 85 minutes .  i highly recommend avoiding  " brain dead "  at all costs ,  unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense .  - merk
discovery channel/animal planet must be ashamed of themselves .  this fantasy is modeled after the  " walking with dinosuars "  series .  even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way .  even mixing the fantasy dragons with t-rexs and the extinction of the dinos .  added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci-fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show .   on its own the show is about an 7 . 5/10 far as entertainment goes .  but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1/10 .  don't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong .  i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real .   i also think this weakens the great  " walking with dinosuars "  series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series . 
i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest .  the presentation is very interesting ,  well presented and the graphics are state of the art ,  but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work .  hydrogen filled flying bladders ?  they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful .  and then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion .  i have no problem with fantasy ,  just don't try to pass it off as fact .  some folks will always misunderstand .  all in all the film is entertaining ,  but i constantly found myself saying  " oh brother ,  what a load of  .  .  .  .  "  .  if you want a fake documentary ,  watch this is spinal tap instead .  or at the very least turn the sound off . 
this documentary  ( or i should say mockumentary )  is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be ,  when they have full enthusiasm on something like that .  honestly ,  i hate cryptozoology .  it is unscience ,  it just destroy it .  however ,  something positive in this was the visual effects  ( dragons were beautiful )  ,  but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake ,  and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists ,  so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 .  an example of false information would be the hydrogen idea :  it is true that ,  according to chemystry ,  the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions ,  so in that case ,  you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach .  there are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly ,  and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing ,  so it is impossible .  anyway ,  there is actually something worse ,  the idea of the platinum :  this element is more difficult to find than gold ,  and i cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that .  it is ridiculous ,  they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet earth ,  but off course at least that explain why they got extincted .  probably cryptologist's call themselves scientists ,  but they are not .  people like them say lies like in this mockumentary ,  and what is worst ,  some people buy them .  but i do not think that a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this .  those fake scientists waste their time . 
let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan .  however ,  this film is not for me .  many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed .  the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries ,  but fails to investigate them more thoroughly ,  which could have given the film some credibility .  the film uses  ( nice !  )  cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life .  this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific ,  which it is definitely not .  in many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched .  in some cases ,  clues used to show dragons possibly existed ,  or flew ,  or spit fire are simply invalid .  to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes .  even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it ,  but this one just doesn't have it .  bottom line :  it's a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary ,  not worth watching . 
in the autobiographical coming-of-age tale  " romulus ,  my father ,  "  eric bana ,  of  " munich "  fame ,  plays an impoverished german émigré struggling to raise his son ,  raymond  ( kodi smit-mcphee )  ,  in rural 1960's australia .  the major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife ,  christina  ( franka potente )  ,  who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men .  despite her highly unconventional behavior ,  romulus refuses to grant her a divorce ,  masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him .  it is ,  unfortunately ,  the good-hearted and good-natured raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie  ( raimond gaita would later grow up to be an author )  .   even though i admire  " romulus ,  my father "  for what it is trying to do ,  i can't honestly say i enjoyed it ,  for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it ,  these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing ,  which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen .  a serious slice-of-life drama is one thing ,  but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery ,  insanity and multiple suicides  ( let alone attempted suicides )  is something else again . 
i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all .   i'm an rpg gamer  ( computer type ,  none of the dnd tabletop stuff )  but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all .   some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot  ( tilt and zoom could've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute )  and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time .   i think i laughed a total of 2-3 times in the entire movie .   the acting itself wasn't all that bad ,  around the standard that a b grade movie should have .   i'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you're a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it . 
this movie is not funny .  it just takes the d&d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them .  all the main characters make less than 30k a year ,  they all live with their parents ,  they're all socially retarded ,  and they have no luck with women .  the jokes are horrible and unimaginative ,  such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on  ( it was his wizard costume )  and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up  ( oh how funny ,  he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports )  .  you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny .  poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch ,  but obviously extremely cheap to make .  i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo .  i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime . 
this movie is just lame .  a total waste of time and money .  the jokes are predictable ,  the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well .  the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and ,  most important ,  how to make jokes about this game .  of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers .  but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game .  the story doesn't make any sense at all .  who cares about how long a game is being played ?  the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it .  i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie . 
'dead letter office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service ,  struggling to rebuild their damaged lives .  unfortunately ,  the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented .  what's most disappointing of all ,  however ,  is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title :  there's no mechanisation whatsoever ,  and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living .  granted ,  part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure ,  but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s ,  if it ever truly existed .  it's a shame ,  as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry ,  and there's some promise in the scenario :  but few of the details convince .  overall ,  it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life ;  a student film ,  with a concept and an outline ,  but sadly little else . 
i usually enjoy films like this .  it's shot documentary style ,  but the acting and writing are just awful .  the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so cliché ,  but not at all in a good way .  as of typing this ,  i'm surprised it's at a 5 . 2/10 on imdb .  i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie .  i suppose if that's the case ,  you might manage a couple of laughs ,  as it's always funny seeing your relatives/friends make a movie .  well ,  in a way ,  i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers ,  directors ,  actors ,  etc .  ,  'cause if they can do it ,  you can do it .  although ,  maybe you shouldn't . 
i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap .  what a waste of time .  beverly d'angelo and william katt ?  wtf ?  were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something ?   truly ,  a piece of unfunny garbage .  the characters were stereotypical without meaning to  ( i think .  .  .  )  and wooden ,  most of them seemed like they were on autopilot .  the so-called  " hilarious "  situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed ,  i weeped for the writers .   i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time ,  seriously .  i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 ,  it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock . 
i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player .  i thought i'd have a good laugh ,  since i've played d&d for half my life .  i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was watching .   finished it later ,  and i should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning .  no ,  they run the gamut of fart jokes ,  cum jokes ,  incest ,  racism ,  dressing up as kkk .  .  .  this movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played d&d .   no wonder it looks like the real d&d wouldn't let them use their game .  who'd want their name attached to this ? 
christopher guest need not worry ,  his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers .  the jokes are beyond lame .  not enough substance to last the typical length of a  ( particularly rancid )  snl skit ,  much less the 87 atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel .  the great william katt  ( greatest american hero ,  house )  deserves much much better .  one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad experience .   my grade :  d-   dvd extras :  2 audio commentaries ;  7 interviews with various cast members ;  4 deleted scenes ;  & theatrical trailer   dvd-rom extras :  2 wallpapers   easter egg :  highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
as a gamer ,  i can't say i like this film .  fact is ,  i down right hate it .  i tried to watch it as open minded as possible ,  but when it gets down to it ,  it feels rather insulting to my social group .   to me ,  there are several reasons why .   1 .  the characters seem unnatural .  i've met lots of players ,  of all different walks of life .  i don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film .  it's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people .  most gamers are rather social people ,  some with rather active lives .   2 .  the style doesn't work .  the mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film .  an actual documentary on gamers would actually work better .  while it is good looking  ( i . e .  cleanly put together )  ,  it isn't very good .   3 .  the dialogue feels forced ,  unnatural .  it also seems to lack any real world context .  gamers swear ,  i'll admit that ,  but we don't have tourette's syndrome .   4 .  the humor is lacking .  while self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups i've encountered ,  this is less self-deprecation ,  and more like toilet humor .  likewise ,  a large part of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes ,  not toilet humor .  most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes .   5 .  the biggest problem to me is basically this :  accuracy .  i don't mean rules ,  but instead dynamics .  invariably ,  this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films the gamers and the gamers :  dorkness rising ,  both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game .  the difference is ,  gamers :  the movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs .  the gamers ,  where you can say something like :   " huh ,  i know a guy like that .  .  .  yep ,  that's definitely like gary .  " 
i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious  " the gamers "  by dead gentlemen productions  ( which is highly recommendable ,  by the way )  .  boy ,  what a disappointment !  the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver .  the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing .  true ,  it can be funny to use every singe cliché there is about role playing games ,  but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable .  already at the beginning of each scene you know what the  " joke "  will be about .  but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top .  there is no subtlety in this movie ,  if there would be captions  " laugh now "  or a cheap 80s-style fake-laughter track it would not make much difference .  with some scenes you can't help to think  " yea ,  i get why they thought this would be funny "  but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke . 
you want to see the movie  " the gamers "  by dead gentlemen productions .  this is not that movie .  this movie is not funny .  it is a waste of time .   all of the good comments here seem to be written by  ( poorly disguised )  false third parties .  the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest .   this movie is not a well done mockumentary .  comparisons to  " spinal tap "  or christopher guest are insulting .   the movie is so mean-spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny .  being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality ,  but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner ,  you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it .   the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality . 
saw a screener of this before last year's award season ,  didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended ,  but whatever ,  maybe for exposure ,  at the least ,  but the movie was a convoluted mess .  sure ,  some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way ,  but none of the characters felt very real to me at all .  there was not one person that i could connect with ,  and i think that is where it failed for me .  sure ,  the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology ,  wow !  what a grand idea .  .  . let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility .  the whole ordeal feels fake ,  from the lighting ,  the casting ,  the screenplay to the horrible visual effects ( which is supposed to be intentional ,  i can tell ,  and so can everyone else ,  no one is laughing with you though )  .  anyways ,  i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least ,  i wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed .  but it's tripe either way .  boring tripe at that . 
i almost never comment on movies ,  but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this  " movie "  and decided i had to weigh in with my own review .  an instructor of mine received this film in the mail ,  mixed in with his academy screeners  ( ampas ,  aka the guys who vote on the oscars )  ,  and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie .   this film has no plot ,  the scenes are horribly ,  horribly edited  ( oftentimes using faux  " 24 "  style picture-in-picture techniques )  ,  and the performances  ( particularly the lead ,  who even fails at acting like a bad actress )  are for the most part ,  obnoxious .  someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction ,  namely ,  the setting up of the plot .  there is no setup !  halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about .  the opening crane shot ,  which sets up some kind of murder ,  is never addressed ,  and now that i think about it ,  was possibly meant to be a flash-forward ,  with the rest of the film being a flashback ,  but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such .   bah ,  i could really go on and on .  at the very least ,  this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability . 
didn't care for the movie ,  the book was better .  does anyone know where it was filmed ?  *** this was my first visit to your site .  .  . just found the answer to my question .  so now i look like a dummy ,  but i think i'll still submit my comments .  and yes ,  british columbia is lovely ***or why they took it from its south carolina coastal setting ?  ( this question stands )  the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie .  oh ,  i just read where i need to write at least ten lines .  here's my other main issue with the film .  kim bassinger was too vapid and not at all what i pictured from the book .  i know ,  the book was the book and the movie ;  well not so good .  i found the character in the book much more empathetic .  also the book evoked rustic ,  almost primitive images of the monastery .  while the  " castle "  in the film was much more visually impressive ,  it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters . 
this movie had a imdb rating of 8 . 1 so i expected much more from it .  it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous .  but before the movie is half-way through ,  it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable .  the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie ,  but we get to know them a little too well ;  they become caricatures ,  not real people at all .  this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times ,  only told here with slightly different circumstances .  the thing is ,  i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale !   the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations ,  and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office .  hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon . 
i had several problems with the movie :     ( 1 )  the screenplay -- specifically ,  kim basinger's voice over :  movies are not books ;  they should *show* the action rather than have a voice over *tell* us what's happening .  occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works ,  but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script .  in fact ,  it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over .    ( 2 )  i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex carter's acting was pretty bad .  that's a significant failure for me in defining jessie's and thomas' characters -- with no connection between them ,  it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex-deprived .  if it had been properly done ,  the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story .    ( 3 )  with the book ,  i understood jessie's mid-life crisis .  in the movie ,  it seemed more like just plain boredom .   on the plus side ,  i didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv  .   .   .  though that thought did occur to me . 
and shot in vancouver with the 'mountains' of the low country of south carolina visible in the background .  for heaven's sake ,  they should have reset the location .  there are no coastal mountains in south carolina .  period .   lame visuals .  they should have been beautiful .  and the story limped along .   i really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book ,  although i have to admit it's one i haven't read as yet .  usually i read the book and give the film a miss .  there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book ,  or even borrow it from the library .   verdict :  the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi . 
kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness !  the plot is so contrived and unbelievable .   .   .  starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain !  then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people ( including clergy )  involved in what is a crime everywhere .  next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces .  a very unpleasant and coo coo mother ,  aided ,  abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends !  moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina ,  did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget .  the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service .  kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade .  also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads .  i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all .  the movie i kept surfing back and forth to ,  had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much .  unless you like an unbelievable story ,  wooden acting ,  a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one .  oh and maybe a small carping criticism ,  but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat ?  the best part of this movie is the scenery
i watched it with my mom and we were like .  .  .   what the hell ?  we didn't get it at all .  i may have this wrong ,  but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father .  that movie was terrible !  this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie .  bad suspense movie !  *shakes cane at movie* i'm never seeing it again .  and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies ,  too !  they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books .  it's driving me crazy !  !  !   and whit was butt-ugly and yet ,  she loves him more than hugh ,  who was a tiny bit nicer-looking .   my rating :  1/10
a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do .  that being stealing from farms and killing prey .  until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem  " solved "  .  they are of course  " out foxed "  at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land .   the " film "  version  , and i use the term film very loosely ,  is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies .  they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely .  so kudos to them  . they'll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book . 
brilliant technology .  but what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish .  i have left after < than 30 minutes of watching ,  being bored and irritated .    the theatre administration returned my money ,  but the time waisted and aggravation remained .  i have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction .    george ,  meryl ,  bill - i hope you were well paid .  you might have even liked it .  so i apologies for my limited mind .  a lot of people seemed to like it too .  look at the comments .  oh well .  .  .   wish to know - what is remotely redeeming in a story about mr fox the husband ,  the father ,  the citizen ,  the  .  .  . whatever . 
i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it .  it was one of worst movies i've ever seen .  i'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie ,  i would probably never talk to them again .  anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry ,  hermit type personality .  i'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too ,  just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie .  i know everyone has different types of humor ,  some people may not even like mine ,  but that's okay ;  i don't think this covers any range of humor though .  this movie is as flat and dull as wes anderson's mind .  go in and get ready to walk out ;  it's best to get your money back too . 
fantastic mr .  fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book .  wes anderson directs ,  and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film .  while i respect what anderson ,  an incredibly talented man did ,  the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit .  anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man ,  and if this happened to be a bad film ,  it would be his first bad film .  just like when you go to school and have your first bad day ,  this is anderson's first bad day in film making ,  so i am going to let him off easy .  i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it ,  and the animation is nice ,  but the film gets progressively harder to get into ,  leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening .  the characters are good ,  also .  jason schwartzman voices mr .  fox  ( george clooney ) 's smart ass son ,  ash ,  and especially engaging .  the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness ,  but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along .  i'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film ,  but for now ,  i'm sorry ,  wes anderson ,  this film of yours was a big disappointment . 
there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's  " fantastic mr fox "  ,  unfortunately all the love is for himself .  granted ,  there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny .  the worrying thing is that i think it was ,  and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with .   the animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals ,  however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess .  there wasn't really anything special about the acting either ,  with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better .  i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park ,  one of them where he played a dog .   the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically ,  despite the film being set in england ,  all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball ,  whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents .  i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is .  i didn't laugh once . 
after viewing the film ,  i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb .   'the fantastic mr .  fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic ,  portraying the story of the smooth ,  slick protagonist mr .  fox  ( or 'foxy' )  as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded boggins ,  bunce and bean .  that's right ,  one short ,  one fat ,  one lean ,  or however it goes .   i don't quite know where to start with my criticism .   well ,  i'm in my late teens and was never a fan of roald dahl ,  but i like his material well enough ,  having read a few of his books as a child and seen matilda and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again .  this film ,  however ,  struggles for an audience .  is it aimed at children ?  adults ?  i'm still unsure !  many of the 'jokes' would bore a child ,  especially as mr .  fox visits a lawyer for example ,  or complains about being poor .  also ,  an audience of  ( i'm assuming )  children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens .  i'm all for the food chain ,  but you practically see mr .  fox biting down on their necks !  surely that's a bit much ?  and also ,  the plot .  .  .  well ,  it's kind of boring .  i stayed only with the hope of it getting better ,  but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions .   the humour ,  meanwhile ,  falls flat .  i laughed only once or twice ,  even though i specifically recognised attempts at jokes .  i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned .  the voice actors have no sense of comic timing ,  instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums .  george clooney aims to portray mr .  fox as charming and sleek ,  but his voice has no character .  meryl streep shows no emotion ,  i didn't even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits ,  and ash ,  twelve-years old in fox-years ,  sounds like he's about 30 .   i love animation ,  particularly stop motion ,  but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit .  characters are tall ,  spindly and lacking any warmth of design .  they move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange .  there is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel ,  as 2d components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully .  characters look straight at the camera and talked ;  it was very awkward .  there was one or two moments when kylie looked straight at the camera ,  didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs .  it actually freaked me out .   fantastic mr .  fox had so much potential .  lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews .  maybe it just wasn't for me . 
you know all those letters to  " father christmas "  and  " jesus "  that are sent every year ?  well ,  it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them .  as bizarre settings go ,  it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is  " dead letter office "  .  having said that ,  this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one .  if it was royal mail ,  most letters get this sort of treatment anyway .  i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang ,  some female priest of the church of latter day i've-never-heard-of-you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company .    " dead letter office "   ( the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up )  follows the story of alice  ( miranda otto )  who grows up in a seriously divided home .  writing to her absent father ,  she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another .  so ,  logically ,  she gets a job at the d . l . o .  and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez  ( george del hoyo )  .  slowly ,  she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the dead letters office to its knees ?   nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god-awful heather graham film  " committed "  while watching this .  however ,  this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again ,  that ain't difficult .  for a start ,  this film is much more logical .  true ,  the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood .  but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel .  it is also well acted .  both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best .  part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly ,  leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed .  the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy  ( i . e .  if you don't speak english ,  rack off !  )  ,  such a story is unlikely to take place in reality .  the other characters ,  sadly ,  also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes .   despite that ,   " dead letter office "  is certainly something a little different .  it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it .  yes ,  it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes ,  it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity  ( no chance of that in an australian film )  .  there ain't any major laughs ,  there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one-dimensional .  but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence ,  it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time .  it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there . 
i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release ,  in a justifiably empty theater .  believe it or not ,  after decades of watching movies ,  this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ;  or at least the worst that i would allow myself to watch .   the acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high-school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less .   after the first shock of disbelief ,  we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows .  but after a while ,  even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad . 
bo derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years  and that's how it should stayed !  john derek was a competent actor but ,  as a director ,  he's virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit ,  considering that bo  ( atypically sporting dark hair )  was only 16 when the film was made !  john also wrote and photographed it ;  the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious !    the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo's family :  they grew up as brother and sister but ,  now in their teens ,  the couple discover they're attracted to one another  ( but ,  as i said ,  don't expect any sexual fireworks !  )  .  still ,  the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness  hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view  ( which ,  of course ,  it does at the finale )  ;  derek's is even nuttier  she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub !  !  for the record ,  the couple are married by the end of the film .   also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo  ( and who ,  naturally ,  incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten )  .  occasionally ,  for no very good reason ,  we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles  ( among the titles shown is the public enemy [1931] )  !  at the end of the day ,  while bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming ,  it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness . 
there are exactly 2 good things to be said about  " fantasies "   ( both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well )  :    a )  bo derek's extraordinary ,  poetry-inspiring beauty .  she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zeta-jones a run for her money ,  and that's a high compliment indeed .  her nudity is brief and discreet ,  but just looking at her face is enough .   b )  the greek island setting ,  with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters .   other than that ,  there is no story ,  the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny  (  " he touched you where you're a woman !  "  )  ,  and peter hooten's character is a slimy jerk .  bo overplays the naivete of her character ,  but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors  ( the fact that she kept saying the name  " damir "  in almost every sentence is a major irritation )  .  oh ,  and although the film is set on a greek island ,  there is hardly a greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there ,  from kids to old people ,  speaks english the whole time .   ( * ) 
reasons to watch the movie :   1 )  bo derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked .  she does a pretty good job playing an immature ,  insecure 16 year old beauty ,  in fact  2 )  many shots of a pretty greek island  but :   1 )  peter hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since brutus played caeser's friend in  " roman senate proceedings of march 15 .  "  he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow .  turn down the volume whenever he speaks .  preferably all the way down  2 )  bo's fantasies are sadly tame ,  especially by today's standards .  a few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model  3 )  the plot is skimpier than bo's costumes
i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode .  i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week .  this is a real problem that far too many afican-american families have dealt with and continue to deal with .  the lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study .  law enforcement including local  ,  state ,  and federal are also complicit .  what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending ?  seemingly ,  television can deal with almost any subject matter except race .  this is shameful . get it together or don't explore it next time . 
he only gets third billing  ( behind arthur treacher & virginia field )  ,  but this was effectively david niven's first starring role and he's charmingly silly as p .  g .  wodehouse's dunderheaded bertie wooster ,  master  ( in name only )  to jeeves ,  that most unflappable of valets .  as an adaptation ,  it's more like a watered-down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing .  and that's too bad since the interplay between treacher & niven isn't too far off the mark .  alas ,  the 'b' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes .  next year's follow-up  ( step lively ,  jeeves )  was even more off the mark ,  with no bertie in sight and jeeves  ( of all people !  )  forced to play the goof . 
this is peter falk's film .  period .   i was 10 years old when this film came out ;  i was already a film maven at the time .  of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out ,  but i was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was an important film .  okay ,  34 years later i've finally seen the film--having never seen any cassavetes-directed film previously .  he's a hack ,  overall .  zero sense of timing ,  editing .  gena's performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman's stint in  " rain man "  :  technically on par but entirely one-note .  as tom cruise stole  " rain man ,  "  falk takes the cake for this film .   i was annoyed with gena's performance ,  really throughout--it seemed better suited for  " awakenings "   ( blecch !  )  .  it's not all her fault :  she's a basket case from first scene to last .  we never find out why ?  ?  but falk's character seems real & is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man .   shave off at least an hour  ( an editor needed !  )  ,  and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple ,  cro-magnon ,  man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work .   i'd rather remember cassavetes for  " the dirty dozen "  or  " rosemary's baby .  "  he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess--as he amply demonstrates with this film .   bob
cassavetes was clearly an intelligent ,  sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films .  he wanted to be an auteur ,  to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema .  for that ,  i applaud him .   unfortunately ,  as a member of his audience ,  i cannot applaud a woman under the influence .  cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic  ( an insane woman )  and somehow managed to craft a dull film ,  filled with lengthy ,  ad-libbed ranting and drawn-out scenes .  he seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person's life on film ,  and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run .  this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real -- or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not .  yet i found the performances ,  particularly rowlands' ,  to be artificial .  i never believed for a moment that she was really insane .  i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed ,  yet i've never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence .  she played it like a very obnoxious ,  uninhibited woman who drinks a lot ,  and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once  ( at the beginning )  ,  but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film .  there are some moments in which she taps into something real ,  but those moments are few and far between ;  she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character .  again ,  i applaud her efforts ,  but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true .   novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly ,  just to prove that they 'get it . ' but don't be brainwashed by the hype -- judge for yourself .  you don't have to pretend to like it .   like woody allen ,  john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film-making ,  seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent .  but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained -- he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie .  if cassavetes had employed some self-discipline  ( and a sharp pair of editing shears !  )  ,  a woman under the influence could have stood a chance .  but what's the point of making a 'realistic' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art-house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti-establishment deity ?  without dumbing anything down ,  i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot ,  instead of presenting a string of 30 minute-long scenes of ad-libbed arguments .  if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans ,  you're just reaching the already converted .  watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it .  if you are truly moved and fascinated by it ,  good for you . 
from actor and independent writer/director john cassavetes ,  a woman under the influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability .  the husband ,  nick  ( played by peter falk )  is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife ,  mabel  ( played by gena rowlands )  the amount of attention that she deserves .  from the onset of the film ,  it is obvious that mabel is very quirky and strange ,  but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that .  crazy .  bonkers .  out of her damn mind .  nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers ,  and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner ,  he asks her if she'll be okay ,  as if he's trying to deny mabel's illness .  her problem only spirals from there .   i did find some particular problems with this film .  i guess these problems were mostly present in the story ,  and the way some of the character acted toward the end .  mabel has been committed ,  because ,  frankly ,  she's nuts .  then ,  six months later ,  she's ready to come out of the hospital ,  and her husband throws a party to welcome her back .  he never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie .  why would he invite all these people ,  some of them strangers to mabel ,  over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state ?  it's simply idiotic .  later ,  after mabel comes in the house ,  mabel's father has a huge outburst at nick ,  screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti .  his daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation ,  and the thing you want to do is keep her calm ,  and he goes nuts over spaghetti ?  a few minutes later in the film ,  nick brings mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable ;  make her weird noises and gestures .  didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things ?  there were various other parts that occurred after this ,  but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail .  i guess i just had a serious problem with the decision by cassavetes to have his characters act in this way .  it simply didn't make sense .   however ,  although i had problems with the ending of the film ,  there was one aspect that really redeemed it ;  the acting .  gena rowlands played an amazing crazy woman .  there were times when i forgot she was acting ,  where i got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that i was actually scared of her .  she was amazingly convincing and intense .  however ,  i was also impressed by the rest of mabel's family .  peter falk played a very strange character ,  and i almost thought he was crazy himself ,  because of the awkward way he handled his children ,  his job ,  and especially the situation with his wife .  i also usually don't appreciate child actors .  but the young people who played nick and mabel's children in this film were phenomenal .  it really felt like they were mabel's children ,  because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem .  i think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together ,  and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense .   in general i wasn't impressed by this film .  the story was jumbled and unclear ,  and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie .  the only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the longhetti family .  their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together ,  and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything . 
in a woman under the influence mabel goes crazy ,  but i can see why she does go crazy .  if i lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has i would go crazy too .  everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it .  she is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer .   to start with the one person closest to her in her life ,  her husband ,  nick ,  is a little off his rocker .  he is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile .  the rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support .  the one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is ,  he is just making her feel worse .  she relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her .  when she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act ,  instead of comforting her ,  he just yells at her and tells her what to do .   the other major people in her life are her parents .  her parents do nothing in her life for her .  mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her .  in the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand ,  and when he does get it he still does nothing .  they do nothing to help mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period .  the only person that tries to do something for her is nick's mom .  nick's mom is adamant about having mabel committed .  she doesn't want to have nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her .  it seems as though everyone is against mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore .  they all want to live their own lives and do nothing for mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't .  that is why she went crazy ,  and why she had to be committed ,  it was her family's entire fault . 
this movie offers nothing to anyone .  it doesn't succeed on any level .  the acting is horrible ,  dull long-winded dribble .  they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for .  complete garbage ,  i can't believe what a laughable movie this was .    and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit ,  a wowing nc-17 movie .  the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens .  pathetic . 
another rape of history  this movie is a catastrophe ;  it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story ,  with bad acting and low budget production .   the movie should be 1/3 the time ,  they just dragged the time to make a mini series .   the battle scenes are so stupid and illogical ,  the solders log stupid ,  the costumes a catastrophe .  the romans were good in fighting in opened areas ,  one of their armies was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest ,  in this movie the romans choose to fight in side the city ,  i mean get real .   and by the way cleopatra was from a macedonian origin ,  which means a light skinned person . 
i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that ,  right until the end ,  i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was .  when you consider the powerful subject ,  the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images ,  it is a shame that little attention was given to acting .   
why is it that any film about cleopatra ,  the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making ?  whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all ,  julius ceasar ,  and his successor ,  mark anthony ,  never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors .  despite lavish sets and costumes ,  this movie is as bad as any italian  " sandals and toga "  extravaganza of the 50's .  admittedly ,  this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen ,  which is why  " gladiator "  went over well ,  but  " gladiator "  did not have all the romance novel sex .   miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor ,  but timothy dalton has talent to spare .  pity some of it didn't wash off on the others . 
i only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw  " cleopatra "  ,  or ,  if they did ,  that they took it as a laugh .  the movie is horrendously inaccurate ,  more laughably ,  even ,  than  " gladiator "   ( which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story )  .  most blatant is octavius ,  caesar's heir ,  in the senate before caesar's assassination :  at the ripe old age of 19 !   besides this ,  the acting is mediocre .  timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says ,   " caesar .  julius caesar .  "  billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony .  and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh  ( who in real life was not good-looking at all )  but comes off as unbelievable .   so this is a warning for all historians--this movie is not true to life ! 
i missed the beginning of this film ,  which might account for why i disliked it so much .  on the other hand i've studied the fall of the roman republic for years so i know the story .  then again ,  that might also be the reason why i disliked this film .   the film has more historical inaccuracies than extras .  though it's so inaccurate that i don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct ,  in which case it can be forgiven .  the odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing .  like throwing in antonius' marriage to octavia ,  and then pushing it aside two scenes later .  why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and octavia is never even seen ?  and like calling antonius by his actual name  ( marcus antonius )  in some scenes ,  and by his strange english name mark antony in other scenes .   though historical inaccuracies aside ,  the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady .  there isn't an ounce of dignity in her .  she's hysterical ,  dramatical ,  and completely lacking control of herself .  instead of being a clever and composed queen cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of pms .  95% of that comes from the poor acting ,  but 5% is also from poor script writing .  far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script .  sometimes you weren't watching antonius and cleopatra ,  you were watching immature versions of dawson and joey from  " dawson's creek "  .   if you want to watch something about this period ,  watch .  .  .  anything but this . 
if this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history .  mark anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted .  he died a coward's death by committing suicide and even then ,  he asked his slave to do it for him .  the slave chose to kill himself instead .  in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the slave's great valor and decided to copy him .  but even in death mark anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt .  he cried out for cleopatra and was taken to her ,  bleeding .  she hauled his litter up on ropes and mark anthony died a while later .  if you want history don't watch this movie .  if you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it ! 
the dvd version consists of 2 episodes ,  the parricide of caesar being the juncture .  in addition ,  the language was spanish without subtitles .  hence ,  it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said .   cleopatra being an historic icon ,  the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer ,  leonor varela just plays fine .  she is strong-willed but also a very supportive ,  tender soul mate .  thimothy dalton as caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode .  so ,  it is not really a documentary ,  nor a peplum but a great love story .   after the parricide ,  a new lover comes  ( marc-antoine )  but the flavor is gone :  we remember always our first love .  so ,  i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully .   nonetheless ,  the production is luxurious :  the sets are big ,  tastefully decorated ;  the moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid .  the producers have a lot of money for sure ,  but they spend nothing on the special effects .  they are so poor  ( blue screens ,  ships ,  sphinx )  that it's funny .   finally ,  i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies . 
i found this a good movie to pass your time ,  but not by any chance of any historical value .  the portrayal of cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera .   the twist of the facts is .  .  .  funny !  she gave birth while feeding her people !  ?  !  ?  o please .  .  .  a pregnant queen of egypt  ( especially this one )  would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason !  they tried to make her appear a saint for god's sake !  and the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister .  .  .  beyond description .   cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time .  her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals .  she did everything for only two reasons :  power and self-preservation !  she was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival ,  something she did very well .  anything that stood on her way was either murdered  ( her brothers and sister )  or seduced  ( ceasar and mark anthony )  .   unfortunately octavian was too powerful to kill and too .  .  .  gay to be seduced .  so ,  he was her end .  .  . 
this version of  " moby dick "  insults the audience by claiming it is based on melville's novel-even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous  " call me ishmael "  .  in addition to having atrocious acting ,  even from john barrymore , this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood  ( especially early hollywood )  would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office . all of the novel's beautiful , poetic language has been absolutely eradicated ,  and ahab has been changed from a brooding , blasphemous , obsessive madman to a dashing , misunderstood hero who only wants to kill moby dick after his fiance (  !  )  turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg .  to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself ,  and a different ending ! 
necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic  " moby dick "  .  john barrymore is captain ahab ,  who falls in love with the pastor's daughter ,  joan bennett .  his brother derek is a rival for ms .  bennett's affections .  when mr .  barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident ,  bennett rejects him .  he must slay the whale and win bennett back .  .  .   there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences ;  particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg .  the film hasn't aged well ,  however ;  there are much better films from the time ,  both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies .  the two name attractions ,  john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best .    **** moby dick  ( 8/14/30 )  lloyd bacon ~ john barrymore ,  joan bennett ,  lloyd hughes
okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not .  before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it .  i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time .  so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought :  the beginning started off fine for me .  it seemed to be heading in a decent direction .  got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie .  don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point .  then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on .  there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing !  its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that .  it had about 3 of these pointless scenes ,  where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward .  then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull .  oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job .  okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention .  thats where it got disturbing .  i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it .  i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so .  .  . i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up .  but if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised . 
i received this movie as a gift ,  i knew from the dvd cover ,  this movie are going to be bad . after not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it .  what a pathetic movie .   i almost didn't finish watching this bad movie , but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie .   trust me when i say  "  this movie sucks "  i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie ,  but it couldn't have cost more than $20 000 to produce this movie .  all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera  . about 15 people with no acting skills ,  a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people .   in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter  ( tara woodley  ) run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town .  he are completely unharmed .  they went to a supposed to be abandon house  , but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there .  just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems .   then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost/zombies stories .   the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history .   his story  sgt .  ben draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion  ( i think this is what happens ) after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse  , ben draper  buries him in a shallow grave .   but sgt .  ben draper are in for n big surprise .  his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt .  ben draper to take revenge on private wilson .  ( next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered )  the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf .   the twist ending were so lame .   even if you like b horror movies ,  don't watch this movie
i suppose that any novel that's as much of a downer as moby dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles .  but any resemblance to the classic herman melville novel is a pure coincidence .    in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it ,  not that too much of it was kept for the film .  we first meet ahab creely  ( he's got a last name and a brother )  as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father mapple's daughter .  that brother derek ,  played by lloyd hughes ,  also wants to marry bennett .   john barrymore is ahab in an over the top performance .  barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in .   we see ahab lose his leg to the great whale moby dick and i have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome .  of course this was all before the code .  still i'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered .   after that the story of ahab's hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in joan bennett's eyes .  that is not exactly melville's motivation ,  in fact there are no women characters in moby dick as he wrote it .   one of the things melville did was invest the crew of ahab's ship the pequod with personalities .  other than queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there ,  but not the personalities .  starbuck and stubbs might as well be smith and jones .   i'd see this version of moby dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else . 
this really should have been a one star ,  but there was so many ,  clichés ,  predictable twists ,  seen it all before slasher flick parallels that i actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh .  .  . although this was never the directors intention im sure .   i don't often write comments about films ,  they have to be either sensational ,  or in this ones case really bad .   to be honest ,  as soon as i saw jeff fahey in it i knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films .   somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through ,  possibly for the hilarious voice of mr t ,   ( not relay mr t ,  but you'll know what i mean if you bother to watch this )  ,  if you do watch it ,  make sure you don't pay to see it .  this may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it ,  but im sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all .  .  . 
a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub-genre .  the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set-pieces that we've all seen a hundred times before .  has great potential as an insomnia treatment . 
this true story of carlson's raiders is more of a army training film than anything else . obviously thrown together quickly on a miniscule budget about the only thing it has to recommend it is an early performance by robert mitchum , who's the only decent actor in the cast , and actual footage of the wreckage at pearl harbor which gets your blood boiling , as it was obviously intended to do . 
the movie 'gung ho ! ' :  the story of carlson's makin island raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war .  it shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda .  the value of this film is only collection and no artistic .  in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors .  watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film .  if you want to see a film for the second world war ,  they exist much better and objective .  i rated it 4/10 . 
should have been titled 'balderdash ! ' little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved .  little more than training film quality with poor camera work ,  muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping 'japs' with laughing japanese infantry ,  laughing japanese fighter pilots and one-dimensional square-jawed americans dying left and right .  sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you .  the plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer's afternoon in my childhood ,  peering through the neighbor's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend steve and my little brother .  in actual fact ,  the makin island raid was a near total failure with carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally ,  thirsty and completely disoriented ,  looking for someone to surrender to ,  before they happened upon some equally confused japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them !  in the withdrawal several of carlson's marines ended up on another island and were abandoned !  the film ,  of course ,  couldn't tell that story ,  not in 1943 ,  so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums .  with randolph scott ,  and his jaw ,  as colonel thorwald  ( carlson )  leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures ,  the green recruit  ( harry landon ,  robert mitchum )  ,  the grizzled veteran  ( j .  carroll naish ,  milburn stone ,  sam levene )  ,  the country-bumpkin  ( rod cameron )  ,  the all-american boy  ( alan curtis )  ,  and scores of sneering  ( when they weren't laughing )  'japs' .  and yet the cast nearly overcomes the material .  almost .  randolph scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel .  but in the end ,  the one-note object of the exercise wins .  any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when randy scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring  ( well sorta stirring )  call to arms .  the cast was better than this material .  so was the audience .  should be viewed with reefer madness and a bottle of moderately priced merlot . 
after reading the reviews ,  it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work .  how utterly boring .  oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it .  of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other .   i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with dan'l boone graced the saturday afternoon matinées .  this was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing ,  yapping ,  farting ,  giggling ,  snot monsters like myself or was-self .  and it was a movie theatre filler at the time .  almost as big as the wizard of oz .   imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot .  problem is was that it was rather a template .  here goes .  randolph scott  ( cowboy/hero ) gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people .  hooray !    all of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it .  that was just about the plot line of every scott ,  john wayne ,  roy rogers film ever made .  if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just don't ask for surprises .   one must remember the context of the times .  there was no or little tv .  none for kids .  there was school .  there was the great outdoors .  there were toy guns .  no cyber time .  and the steam age had just collapsed .  but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers .  even the girls got into it .   this movie was the entertainment .  and it is just as mindless as anything produced today .  it had a purpose originally of being propaganda .  but quickly came to be kids movies .   our fathers had experienced the real thing .  and it wouldn't be until sam peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities .  not until his directorship did anyone die slowly ,  with great pain and miserably .  until peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair .  thanks sam .   to see a movie had little or no blood ,  the adults didn't mind .  they wouldn't have tolerated it i think .  no guts spraying the shattering plant life .  so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory .  gung ho was suitable for kids then .   you will see that i assigned a four to this rating .  why would i do that ?  well .  it is a terrible movie .  no matter how i love it .  i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood .  but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms .  basically gung ho transitted to become a romance novel for children .   should people watch it .  of course .  i am not saying to stay away .  realistically however .  the plot is simple .  the characters shallow ?  they are shoals .  you can love a bad movie . 
dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit ,  the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border .  there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by the wild bunch's walon green ,  jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast  ( harvey keitel ,  warren oates ,  valerie perrine )  ,  tony richardson directing  ( although he was pretty much a spent force by then )   but now it doesn't even turn up on tv .  the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption ,  with nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism ,  until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business .  unfortunately ,  he never really gets his hands dirty ,  barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface .  the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and ,  sadly ,  the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original ,  nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers .   while that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film ,  it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity :  at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint ,  then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him ,  one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level .  the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease  ( and one impressive car stunt )  in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely .  what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring .  unfortunately ry cooder's beautiful title song ,  across the borderline ,  says it all much more economically .  but if you want to know the film's real crime ,  it's completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part .  when even he can't make an impression ,  you know something's really wrong .  all in all ,  all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time . 
i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained ,  and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way ,  plus scenes of a decaying corpse .    neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner .   the film's plot ,  such as it is ,  concerns three loosely interconnecting stories ,  none of which conclude satisfactorily .   the bounty hunter ,  played by bruce dern ,  is the character that connects all three vignettes .   first we have dylan mcdermott ,  looking darn fine ,  as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter ,  when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt .   then we have one of the hemingway girls ,  not sure which one ,  playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman ,  an attractive redhead ,  whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long .   the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him ,  with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension . 
this was not a well done western .  you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it ,  killing people for his own reasons .  you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard ,  cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten .  then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there .  what is the point of this film ?  couldn't bruce dern find something better to do ?  this was a waste of film . 
do not waste your time or your money on this movie .  my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent  ( the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave )  .  so ,  we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad .  it was .  i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public .  it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself .  i honestly feel emotionally scarred .  it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick .  and really not a good one .  i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him .  almost .  all in all ,  an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason .  don't waste your money .  and don't let your kids watch it . 
one of the worst films ever .  not funny ,  poor tv style cinematography ,  bad acting .  sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk ,  let alone act .  lead female nancy young can't act .  terrible direction .  sub-par with bad tv movies .  occasional weak jokes fall flat .  even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense .  somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions .  slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it .  the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny ,  but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny .  how did they even get the money to make this ? 
if you have beloved actors ,  peter falk ,  rip torn ,  george segal ,  and bill cobbs ,  you don't need billy burke ,  coolio ,  or any other distractions .  massive talent is totally wasted in  " three days to vegas "  ,  with the blame falling squarely on the script .  my neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie .  if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script ,  check out  " the crew "  .  there really are no redeeming factors here ,  and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime .  i wanted to like it ,  but the shallow script cheats the audience ,  by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with .  - merk
i agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased  " for the birds "  won the oscar in 2002 for  " best animated short ,  "  not this sick material ,  which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone ,  of course ,  who has no belief in heaven or hell .   the animation was good ,  but so are a lot of animated shorts .  and ,  by the way ,  i love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start .   as for the story here :  a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey  ( symbolism here )  is told by a tv set  ( which appears every few hundred yards away )  that he is in either heaven ,  hell ,  or purgatory .  each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news .  i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances . 
this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense .  the premise of the story ,  the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father , is very good .  but the story just seems to beggar belief .  whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it .  it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing . 
this movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a mom  ( lisa hartman black )  who acts like a man would in an action thriller .  unlike other movies where the focus is on the police ,  here the mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son .  she gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her .   before finally catching up with her son ,  a lot of bizarre things happen .  the mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local children's play at a community theater .  she gets caught ,  and then realizes it is not her child .  that alone would have gotten most people put into the mental ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial .  however ,  in this movie the mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her .  a little while later mom breaks into her mother-in-law's house and then the police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her  ( and feel sorry for her ?  )  .   at another point in the story they have found the child ,  but when the police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the dad kept around just for such an emergency escape !  the mom gets someone to lend her a raft ,  and even though it must have taken some time  ( in a real world )  ,  she and the lawyer-boyfriend ,  and the police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall .  instead of getting out of the raft to search for the dad on the land ,  mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket .  of course ,  she cannot swim and sinks like a rock .  the lawyer saves her ,  but they miss a chance to run after the dad .  at one point the mom is told her son died at a clinic in mexico .  on and on it goes ,  and where it stops nobody knows !  in some ways ,  this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive .  on the other hand ,  seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun  ( or funny ?  )  . 
i just finished  " dark chamber "  aka  " under surveillance "  and i'm stunned .  stunned ,  not by the film ,  but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it .  the story was so ravaged by plot-holes and the majority of the acting so flat ,  categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate .  seriously ,  i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie .   justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's warnings that dad is no good .  when a young woman is found murdered ,  justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments .  with the help of a couple pals ,  he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks .  as the truth begins to unravel ,  justin uncovers an unexpected secret .   one positive point is that felissa rose is hot !  i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit ,  but no such luck .  it would have been the film's potential saving grace .  eric conley played justin very adeptly ,  i thought ,  and i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future .    the general premise of the film ,  although plagued by clichés ,  might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow  " performances "  of key cast members ,  most notably alexandra eitel  ( kayla )  and david h .  rigg  ( justin's father )  .  the horror !   ( pardon the pun )  .   i have nothing against low-budget films .  indeed ,  i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come .  i'll cut low-budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects ,  lighting ,  even musical score and the overall picture quality .  i don't give allowances ,  however ,  for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script .  there are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there .  sadly ,  this isn't one of them .  i can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised  " dark chamber "  here are in some way affiliated with its production . 
justin goes home to live with his strict ,  hard-nosed police detective father ,  but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments each with bizarre tenants residing in them .  straight-laced idealist justin is thrust into the world of the occult ,  murder ,  under-aged drinking and other dastardly things .  ho-hum   wow ,  have i seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw ?  ?  ?  clever ,  compelling ,  original ,  intense ,  clever ,  genius ?  ?  ?  ?  !  !  ?  i witnessed none of those things .  what i did see was an uninteresting ,  bland ,  trite ,  extremely clichéd low-budget thriller that was ripe with implausibilities and no tension in the least bit as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film as he gives his monologue/debate/discussion .  and where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moments ?  i never so much as chuckled ,  perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film .   my grade :  d   dvd extras :  audio commentary with director dave campfield ;  second commentary with various contributers as well as isolated music tracks ;  4 featurettes  ( making of ,  on the set ,  turning 1 room into 4 ,  & inside the black circle )  ;  interviews with felissa rose ,  desiree gould ,  & raine brown ;  alternate scenes ;  bloopers ;  a music video for 'addiction' ;  a trailer for this movie ;  and trailers for  " shock-o-rama "  ,   " chainsaw sally "  ,   " skin crawl "  ,   " sinful "  ,   " bacterium "  ,   " creature from the hillbilly lagoon "  ,  &  " millennium crises " 
when stanwyck's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding ,  she retreats to a mountain lodge ,  where she slips  ( sort of )  off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan .  morgan falls in love with her ,  leading to a definitely one-sided marriage ,  spent on a huge estate in chicago  ( which appears to be surrounded by mountains !  )  .  stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez ,  but eventually returns to morgan ,  in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution .   this film has a great cast  ( morgan in particular is one of my favorites )  and a great director ,  but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times .  i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed .  still worth watching for the cast ,  and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films . 
another british cinema flag waver .  real garbage on offer here once again .  i cannot understand  ( and i am british )  why this over the top ,  patriotic nonsense was ever made .  eight years mark you ,  from when the second world war had actually ended !  other commenter's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage .  this is extremely poorly observed .  the archive footage is in abundance .  model aircraft swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind .  the usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole malta event .  guinness must have his worst acting performance ever .  the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable .  hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area .  ealing made many great movies .  this clearly is not one of them .  they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot ! 
in the opening scene of  " malta story "  mr a . guinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be  " certain women need striking regularly - like gongs "  or some such world - weary bon mot . unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life . indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one . and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie . mr j . hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a  " jack hawkins "  performance without an ounce of individuality . it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies . many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose .  the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees . the courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george cross . a worthy subject you might think for a movie , but  " malta story "  does not even qualify for the term  " worthy "  in its most patronising sense . it gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline , perhaps before the actors lost the will to live . 
if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault ,  then this film is not the film that you want to watch .  it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back .  spoiler :  rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant .  instead of using the criminal justice system ,  the victim resorts to using vigilantism .  she in essence nullifies the judicial system .  the film  " the accused "  was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins .  what the  " descent "  does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence ?  is victim any better that the accuser ?  no !  !  ! 
i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros .  i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that .  but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia .  the movie never really gets through to the person ,  his thoughts and feelings .  what they did was to collect the little material that they had ,  shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire .  it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all ,  and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say ,   " oh ,  he was such an inspiration to all of us "  .  like bono or johnny depp  ( whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean )  .  it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of  " the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart "  that ever lived ,  sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him .   sure ,  being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band ,  hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such ,  but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60-90 minutes .   go see the movie if you are a fan ,  otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros ,  where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death ,  melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound . 
strummer's hippie past was a revelation ,  but overall this felt like crashing a wake .  campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire .  there were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage .  i love the clash and joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now  ( fu mick jones )  ,  but this doc left me wanting .  . to relate more .  using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent .  they should have been interviewed on their own .  even using strummer's 'radio dj voice' did little to glue the film together .  and can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes ?  after the awesome  " filth and the fury "  i hoped temple could deliver .  a joe strummer doc deserves better . 
growing up ,  joe strummer was a hero of mine ,  but even i was left cold by this film .  for better and worse ,  the future is unwritten is not a straightforward  " behind the music "  style documentary .  rather it is a biographical art film ,  chock full of interviews ,  performance footage ,  home movies ,  and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from  " animal farm .  "  the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour .   the campfire format ,  while touching in thought ,  is actually pretty annoying in execution .  first off ,  without titles ,  its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are .  secondly ,  who really needs to hear people like bono ,  johnny depp ,  and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man ?  they were not relevant to strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story .   this picture is at it's best when strummer ,  through taped interviews and conversation ,  touches on facets of his life most people did not know about :  the suicide of his older brother ,  coming to terms with the death of his parents ,  the joy of fatherhood .  to me ,  these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved ,  but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face .   there have been better ,  more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash .   ( westway ,  vh1 legends ,  and kurt loder's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind .  )  joe strummer :  the future is unwritten is for diehards only . 
as i write this review in 2008 ,  we are mired in a remake culture .  movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'king kong ,  'the wicker man' and practically every film that ever starred michael caine .  this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon ,  however ,  as 'dough for the do-do' proves .  an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampett's surreal masterpiece 'porky in wackyland' ,  'dough for the do-do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng .  freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampett's source material ,  although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampett's inspired insanity .  inevitably ,  then ,  'dough for the do-do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached .  for cartoon fans like myself ,  its equivalent to a colorization of 'casablanca' . 
 " dutch schultz "  ,  aka arthur fleggenheimer ,  was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented .  this movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character ,  because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology .  not only that ,  it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate n . y .  and his religious conversion .  it is true that he was executed by luciano ,  lansky ,  et .  al .  but that's as far as it goes .  the exploding plate scene which represents luciano carrying out the execution of bo weinberg in his own home ,  assisted by his own mother is rediculous .  also ,  there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond .  it just doesn't work .  the character of mrs .  fleggenheimer doesn't work either .  this movie does not need a doting jewish mother for comic relief .  the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough .  i'm sure the man is turning in his grave .  and ,  by the way ,  dutch did in fact personally kill people ,  but ,  he was not rambo or 007 .  the scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd .  i don't know .  maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didn't get it . 
this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles ,  itself brilliant ,  but not this .  nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why ,  he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot .  my gawd ,  who would find this funny .  sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny ,  well cause it's simply not funny .  it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny ,  just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles .  did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot ?  flat out ,  they didn't care .  it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out .  i guess it's useful for historical purposes only ,  or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be . 
i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles ,  one of my all time favorites !  !  the tv pilot for black bart stunk .  the plot was non-existent and the acting was not good .  it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies ,  but this one would never have worked .  considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie ,  it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the  " n "  word thrown around .  on the other hand ,  i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces !  !  !  there were quite a few actors/actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years .  i had to write down all the names and do a few searches .  that was fun .  i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash .  i won !   :  ) 
this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition  " blazing saddles "  .  imagine the movie without the satire ,  humor ,  or writing skills .  but with all the trappings of a typical lame '70's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was .  what the hell was lou gossett jr .  thinking when he signed onto this disaster ?  ?  this was possibly the worst thing he's been in  ( and yes i'm including the first  " punisher "  movie and  " iron eagles 3 "  .  steve landesberg ,  i understand as he can't say no to crap .   my grade :  f
to review this movie ,  i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's  " pulp fiction "   ( 1994 )  when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living .  jules tells vincent that the  " only thing she did worthwhile was pilot "  .  vincent asks  " what the hell is a pilot ?  "  and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is :   " well ,  the way they make shows is ,  they make one show .  that show's called a 'pilot' .  then they show that show to the people who make shows ,  and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows .  some pilots get picked and become television programs .  some don't ,  become nothing .  she starred in one of the ones that became nothing .  "  now to stretch on what jules was talking about ,  there are billions of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not .  .  . well ,  good .  probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is  " w*a*l*t*e*r "  ,  a spin-off to  " m*a*s*h "  with gary  " radar "  burghoff as the lead .  hmmm ,  would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes ?  hence ,  the show was never picked up .  what many people don't know  ( or what they thought they knew )  is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air ,  for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide .  some have made they're way past and got onto the air  ( the pilot for the animated series  " american dad "  comes to mind ,  as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later .  however ,  there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air ,  and this here is why .    " black bart "  ,  a supposed tie-in with the mel brooks comedy classic ,   " blazing saddles "  ,  is a stale and bland  " sitcom "  with little heart and no soul .   " saddles "  was a controversial comedy ,  nevertheless ,  with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy ,  which comes to mind  " what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv ?  !  ?  "  i say  " supposed "  ,  because none of the memorable characters from the movie ,  aside from bart ,  on in this mess of a tv show .  mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line  ( in a related story ,  i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie  " clerks .  "  that kevin smith was no involved in .  .  .  . you see what happens ?  !  ?  )  .   set somewhere around the same time as the movie  ( or at all )  ,  the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west ,  named appropriately 'black' bart ,  who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr .  ,  obviously before his stint in  " real "  acting ,  whereas in this he is playing a  " g-rated "  richard pryor .  most of the other characters are carbon  ( if not ,  really bad )  copies of the characters in the movie :  jim ,  the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan ,  a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun .  lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer ,  a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich-type accent and personality .  while that's pretty much the end in similarities ,  the lead  " bad guy "  in the story is fern malaga ,  played by noble willingham ,  who i assumed would've been hedley lamar if warner bros .  secured the rights to the name  ( see trivia for  " blazing saddles "  )  and his son curley .  .  . i dunno ,  taggart i suppose ?  the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom ,  much less a pilot .  bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin .  really ,  it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the  " series "  and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an  " alright "  show .  i can't really call it a sitcom  ( and even if i wanted to )  and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros .  studios and later added a laugh track ,  so the show is set up almost exactly like  " m*a*s*h "   ( complete with a bland and dull  " laughing "  that is identical to the series )  .  the acting is so-so ,  but there's one part that always make me laugh ,  and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue .  ha !  the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie  ( surprisingly ,  they use the word  " n***er "  numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode ,  rather touchy for it's time period and even for today )  and it gets repetitive .   if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss .  .  . surly interesting novelty item ,  watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots  ( it's on the collector's edition of  " blazing saddles "  ,  god knows why )  .  there ,  yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air . 
watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again .  even when you thought ,   " that mackerel surely can't be coming around again ,  "  *slap* there it was .  i'm not sure what they were thinking .  this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered ,   " did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series ?  "  not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well .  and while  " blazing saddles "  made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness ,  these stereotypes were just downright offensive .  there was no plot line ,  the ending was slapped on ,  and the jokes aren't .  still ,  if you are a student of comedy ,  watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do . 
this movie was disgusting .  their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage .  what is garbage ?  the misuse of peoples time ,  the misuse of energy ,  and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write .  talia you are a sick demented loser .  your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem .    the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage .  i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for .  if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie .  i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie  " no more support from me .  "  how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho ?  i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene .  i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is ;  congratulations you won his attention . 
a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks' blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom ,  this is really as bad as some people say it is !   the laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is !   however ,  it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr .  trying his best to impersonate cleavon little .  his embarrassment shows through in every scene .  he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese !   truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse ! 
 " black angel "  is minor whodunit ,  with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance .  dan duryea  ( the husband of the murdered woman )  decides to help vincent find the real culprit .  peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect .  this film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer ,  never achieving anything special .  it is pleasant enough but then ,  at some point ,  it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big  " give me a break "  reactions .  that ending alone could have sank the film completely ,  but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either .  vincent is a wimpy heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys .  i love film noirs ,  but this one was a real disappointment . 
dan duryea ,  a perfectly decent b-movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s ,  can't do much with this one :  young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer ;  when he's sentenced to die ,  his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband .  after a dazzling opening shot ,  flick quickly settles into b-movie formula .  it certainly looks good ,  but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast  ( including peter lorre and broderick crawford )  is just a bit stiff .  based on a cornell woolrich novel ,  and passable for a single viewing .    ** from ****
it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes .  apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny .  his skull-like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake ,  but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow .  not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch ,  but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing .  not only that ,  but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap .  so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester .  whatever the cap was made of ,  it looked very new and artificial .  jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits ,  but brett did not have to dress-up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part .  frewer on the other hand is painful to watch .  even in the full  " holmes "  outfit ,  he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes .   frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad  " upper-crust "  british accent is painful to see and listen to .  to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement .  after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum ,  he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait .  when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone ,  the jack russell terrier .  i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone .  but sadly ,  there is no dog in this movie except for frewer .  wishbone would have made this movie a lot better .   not only does frewer's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking  ( in that awfully artificial british nasal accent )  ,  but he is much to friendly and kind .  frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to ,  and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth .  perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production ,  they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes  ( wishbone was better at that ,  too )  that was kindler and gentler .  whatever the point of frewer's interpretation of sherlock holmes ,  it is flatter than a pancake ,  and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen  ( including the previous worst ,  by charlton heston )  .   overall ,  the tone of this film is awful .  it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder .  all the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed .  holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie .  even on murder she wrote there is less exposition .   this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo .  the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer .  it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes ,  especially the bbc version with jeremy brett .  this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie .  the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help .   the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity .  walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer ,  and when he is often interviewing witnesses ,  his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible .  unfortunately ,  the rest of the cast is amateurish ,  and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other  ( to show they are suspicious )  is something that i had not seen in any modern movie . 
as a casual listener of the rolling stones ,  i thought this might be interesting .  not so ,  as this film is very 'of its age' ,  in the 1960's .  to me  ( someone born in the 1980's )  this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap ,  but i am sure this film was not made for me ,  but people who were active during th '60's .  i expected drugs galore with th stones ,  i was disappointed ,  it actually showed real life ,  hard work in the studio ,  so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film .  i have not seen any of the directors other films ,  but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing ,  sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash ,  badly directed ,  tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value .  my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it ,  it came free with a sunday paper . 
it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously - and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist .  it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant .  anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them .  as a filmmaker ,  ask yourself :  would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience ,  and then ,  when you couldn't think of anything else to do ,  layer another voice-over to the first voice-over ,  which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case ?  brilliant ,  jean-luc !  as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones :  of course he did ;  wouldn't you ?  it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place :  the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera .  the bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre ,  and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen .  copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience .  ironic that godard's one-time great friend ,  truffaut ,  with nuit americain ,  made the best film about film-making ever ,  and godard made the worst with le mepris !  incidentally ,  godard didn't choose the stones' track of sympathy with the devil .  it just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at barnes olympic studios . 
picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market ,  was pretty excited .   i found it fascinating for about 15 min ,  then just repetitive and dull .   it is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime ,  i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playing .   the skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple ,  sort of poorly written monty python on acid .  i spent more time looking at the late 60's england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits .   this movie is a good reminder that times really change , and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly .  good song ,  but it has now been played to death by this dvd . 
firstly ,  this is a very dated film ,  non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution .  honestly ,  when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual  (  which in itself is quite nonsensical ,  since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual )  it reduces me to despair ;  as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous .  our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities ,  but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree .  but no doubt this non-educational message ties in with godard's use of rock music ;  hence the rolling stones .   the song 'sympathy for the devil' ,  whose creation we witness ,  and from which the film takes its name ,  is in fact nothing special .  the chord sequence ,  which is not especially original ,  was used to much better effect in led zeppelin's 'thankyou' ( led zeppelin ii )  .  apart form that ,  'sir' mick jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner  ( rather like bob dylan ) - notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse .   besides the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film ,  don't seem to know what they are fighting for ,  the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography ;  a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today  (  indeed ,  a message that would belie the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made )  .   no wonder ,  the dvd came free with the sunday times !  for a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy ,  listen to luigi nono's masterpiece ,  'al gran sole carico'd'amore' . 
jean luc godard's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker .  bits of political theater ,  mind-numbingly boring and interminable ,  are interspersed with the making of  " sympathy for the devil "  ,  featuring the rolling stones in the studio .   the process of the song's development ,  from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar ,  to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end ,  is fascinating ,  and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones .  almost half the movie is devoted to this ,  so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops ,  you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together .   when i had this on laserdisc ,  i valiantly attempted to watch it all ,  but i don't see how anyone could get through it .  i finally gave up and just chapter-skipped my way to the stones segments . 
the film-school intellects can drool all they want about the important  ( imagined )  meaning of this film ,  but it's just that :  intellectual drool .  this film is creatively bankrupt ,  and some mistake it's endless self-indulgent wanking as substance .  yeah .    obviously godard wasn't a stones fan .  too bad ,  because this could have been great .  he's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap .    then there's the endless shots of what looks like 60's librarians spray-painting words on people's cars .  and then there's the seemingly neverending  " interview "  where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions .  there's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book ,  which goes on for ,  oh ,  only about 20 minutes .  and black panthers or something in a junkyard .   it almost sounds intriguing ?  well ,  it's not .   but for unwashed film-school hipsters who don't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag's ,  this film's a real winner !   more accurately .  .  . maybe godard just blows . 
i'm going to write about this movie and about  " irreversible "   ( the  ( in ) famous scene in it )  .  so you are warned ,  if you haven't seen the movie yet .  this are just my thoughts ,  why i think the movie fails  ( in the end - pun intended )  .   acting wise ,  rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger  ( a teenager in other words )  .  the villain guy is good ,  but loses his  " evil "  touch right before the end .  if he really never changes ,  then why would he let a woman tie him up ?  he wouldn't ,  period .  then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude .  actually i don't think you would need him .  at least not for the 2nd rape ,  but more about that later on .   let's reprise the story .  rosarios character is sexually insecure ,  might even have lesbian tendencies  ( see her scene with a female friend )  .  this wasn't intentional ,  as rosario states herself ,  but there is sexual tension between them .  rosario's character meets a guy ,  who is a sexual predator ,  in all the bad senses .  but he makes an impression on her .   rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before .  i beg to differ .  because she acts ,  as if it is her first boyfriend ,  which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother .  talking about her mother ,  here's another problem .  after the first rape takes place ,  rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened .  seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one ,  nothing of that gets explored after that .  if rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely ,  the mother would be worried like crazy .  there was so much potential here .  also her female friend :  we see her at the party ,  it's obvious there is something going on and  " boom "  she is gone .   the first rape is almost unbearable to watch .  but feels like a pinch ,  when you compare it to the ending  ( rape )  ,  which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer !  after rape no .  1 we get too stretched out scenes .  threads are opened  ( such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian ,  as one guy states who tried to hit on her  .  .  .  )  ,  but left in the open .  no real social contact is established ,  if you leave the bartender guy out ,  who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene .  it's apparent that he isn't a  " nice "  guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit .  but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again ,  his being in the movie seems pointless .  we get the point that rosarios character isn't the same anymore ,  that she went  " bad "  and is able to hurt people .   ( too )  many scenes show exactly that ,  her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff .  back to rapist #1 who cheats on a test ,  gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again  ( really ?  )  .  as absurd as that sounds ,  the guy meets up with her ,  not without us having seen him beforehand ,  with another girl  ( very likely that he raped her too ,  although we never see anything of that ,  fortunately )  and his football career .  well career is a stretch and he is bullied .  this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works ,  but then again is too cliché to stay with you .  so rapist #1 submits to rosarios character  .  .  .  why exactly ?  because he promised her ,  it was her day ?  again ,  really ?  a guy like that never loses control ,  especially with a woman he raped before  .  .  .  i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is .  the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something ,  but letting him submit like that ,  just feels wrong .  another possibility would have a drug in his drink .   so rapist #1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed  .  .  .  .  seriously ,  that's just crazy !  but what comes next ,  is even crazier .  first she talks to him ,  then she  " shuts "  him up and forces an object into him .  this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one .  this isn't about what this guy deserves or not ,  it's just intense .  and of course that was what they were aiming for .  now after she is  " done "  the bartender guy comes in and rapes  .  .  .  rapist #1 .  if this really should work as a revenge movie ,  it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the  " revenge "  .  having a henchman doing the job ,  takes away everything that was built up .   this isn't supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable ,  it's a hard watch & it is art-house .  but the 10 minute  ( i didn't count  )  rape scene at the end ,  just smashes everything .  rosarios character is more or less ,  only watching what happens .  which brings me to the biggest disappointment .   irreversible comparison :   " irreversible "  had the rape scene ,  but the movie went on  ( even if it was back into time )  .  rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this .  first ,  that comes a bit too late ,  that should see her say that after the initial rape .  and secondly and most importantly ,  this is where the art-house movie should've come in .  it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope ,  with what she had done .  but then again ,  she didn't actually physically do that much  ( see above )   .  .  .  a broken character that the movie cuts off  .  .  .   good intentions  ( talia and rosario had worked before )  ,  but failing to convey most of the things ,  they set out to do  ( even if you can see what they meant ,  it has to be convincing ,  otherwise it doesn't work )   .  .  .  not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are  .  .  . 
in the 60's ,  having as the background the rehearsal and recording of  " sympathy for the devil "  in the classic album  " beggar's banquet "  by the revolutionary bad boy rolling stones  mick jagger ,  keith richards ,  charlie watts ,  bill wyman and brian jones  plus marianne faithful ,  godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements  the black power through the black panthers ,  the feminism ,  the communism ,  the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters :   " the stones rolling ;   " outside black novel "  ;   " sight and sound "  ;   " all about eve "  ;   " the heart of occident "  ;   " inside black syntax "  ;  and ,   " under the stones the beach "  .    " sympathy for the devil "  is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director jean-luc godard .  the narrative and the footages are awful ,  but fortunately i love the stones and  " sympathy for the devil "  and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers ;  otherwise this documentary would be unbearable .  my vote is three .   title  ( brazil )  :   " sympathy for the devil " 
i mean really .  this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind .  okay ,  if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do ,  then maybe .  i think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have ,  and this is not the vehicle for it .  come on now ,  this film is just tacky . 
at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue .  this is absolutely not a girls film .  any blokes who like it ,  are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from .  dumb story ,  mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film .  i've seen many ,  many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category .  if you do happen to see it ,  the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending .  so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can . 
the cover art  ( which features a man holding a scary pellet gun )  would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film .   ( hardly .  )   i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior .   ( trojan is a brand of condoms in the us )  this movie is loaded with homoeroticism .  if you like that stuff ,  then this film isn't that bad really .  however ,  consider these points :   there are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts ,   ( one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants .  )  the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime ,  peach ,  and red .  from a cinematographer's standpoint ,  this movie's a drag queen !  several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another ,  occasionally touching as they converse .  also ,  the cousin of the hero likes women ,  and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him .  is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ?    shall i go into the fight scenes ?   ( yes ,  someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight .  )  the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative .  no fancy stuff here ,  just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick .  there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film . 
well our standards have gone into the toilet .  the direction was poor ,  the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish .  and those are the good points .  hopefully there won't be a sequel .  otherwise ,  i might have to leave the country . 
after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar  .  .  .  i found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait .   this movie is listed as being in a number of genres ,  and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them .  80% through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead .  bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste . 
spoilers herein  my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams .  but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker ,  who was none other than australian kickboxing's favorite son ,  stan  " the man "  longinidis .  the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone ,  because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him .  now ,  his speech was full of the usual  " if you fail to prepare ,  then prepare to fail "  stuff ,  but there were various instances where i got really worked up .  the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else .  he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing ,  but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia's greatest kick-boxer .  he said that he wasn't a sell-out ,  he was happy and a retiree ,  he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film .  yes ,  you heard right ,  he plugged his new film .  as he talked about it ,  he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it ,  and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called  " trojan warrior "  .   ( this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight  ( for now )  )   stan plays ajax ,  a kick-boxing ex-special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne .  ajax's cousin ,  theo  ( arthur angel )  recently sold out  ( well ,  at least stan didn't stray too far away from everything )  to the feds ,  and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime .  ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations ,  from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party .  it's all pretty ridiculous ,  but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here ,  this man should never be handed a camera again .    i'll admit ,  i was actually pumped to see this .  i love action films ,  even if they're corny ,  and especially if it's set in my own backyard .  but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word  " go "  ,  and continued to do so after the words  " for the love of god please make it stop !  "  ,  subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open ,  characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever ,  and the most over-choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect stan's actual talent in kickboxing .  the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous  ( dermot brereton ,  mark  " chopper "  read and greg matthews )  .  the whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background .  too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities .  remember those plot-holes i told you about ?  ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up ,  wrongly accused for murdering his wife .  now ,  we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film ,  and then leave it for buggery .  this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up .  then ,  get this ,  at the end ,  it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn't actually dead ,  but was sold into prostitution .  do we see her ?  no .  does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this ?  no .  now that's a marriage !    amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap ,  some website described this film as  " a cross between jackie chan & guy ritchie "  .  has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film ?  !  chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing ,  well ,  anything !  and guy ritchie is the crime-film messiah ,  and you're comparing him to salik silverstein !  ?  this film is more like a mix between  " pizza "  and  " enter the ninja "  .    now ,  where do you thing the whole  " trojan warrior "  title comes from ?  ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior ?  no .  the gangsters' unification to find theo ,  like that of the trojan empire ?  no .  it's because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him .  yes ,  that right ,  because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket ,  he is a trojan warrior !    i had the displeasure of seeing  " trojan warrior "  on dvd ,  as well as it's  " special "  features :     video clip of  " chop chop "  ,  a rap song by mark  " chopper "  read :  chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap .  the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster ,  using such words as  " dis "  and  " dope "  etc in their australian accents .  face it people ,  rap was developed in the states ,  leave it there !  the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together .     bloopers :  there was no real difference between these and the actual film .     stan  " the man "  longinidis kickboxing featurette :  this wasn't too bad ,  considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles  ( i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage )  .   i don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film ,  but .  .  .  oh wait ,  i just did .  my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of  " trojan warrior "  ,  tape them together ,  and use it for a paperweight ,  because this movie is just that damn bad . 
this movie was horrible .  i swear they didn't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie .  ice-t was annoying as hell .  *spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it* they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes .  he coulda been long gone .  the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs .  and when ice-t is on that hill and uses that spaz-15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle  ( and then cuts down a tree with eight shells ?  ?  it would take 1000's of shells to cut down a tree that size .  )  shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards .  and they even saw the reflection .  what reflected the light ?  ?  i didn't see a scope on that thing .  also when he got shot in the gut and kept going ,  that was retarded he would of bled to death right there .  plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel .  it wouldn't blow up and kill him .  the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel . 
ice-t stars as mason a homeless african-american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters  ( rutger hauer , gary busey , charles s .  dutton ,  f . murray abraham , william mcnamara and john c .  mcginley )  however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them . 
this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite .  not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies ,  but you'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide .  and upon reaching the hunting grounds ,  poor ice-t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before .   and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle ?   i'm assuming this movie was based on richard connell's short story  " the most dangerous game .  "  a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story .  i reedited the movie ,  cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity .  it ended up being 43 minutes long . 
this movie sucked plain and simple .  okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped ,  and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist .  the rapist is a douche ,  but the girl victim is partly to blame .  i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff ,  but when the rapist tries to have sex with her ,  she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her .  and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything ,  but when it comes to the rapist getting raped ,  it's a pretty long rape scene .  there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching .   3 . 2/10
had the original casting idea been kept  ( hunting rutger ,  not ice-t )  ,  this movie might have worked .  sadly ,  racism had to come into the picture  ( literally )  and mess it up .  the predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black ,  so they swapped rutger's and ice-t's roles .  this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film .  ernest dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment .  master shot ,  close up ,  close up .  gads ,  'who's line is it anyway' even uses more creative camera work .  eric's rewrite of 'the most dangerous game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale ,  but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this .  we are never given the reasons ,  other than  " no one will miss these people "  ,  why the leader  ( re-written as rutger )  does these things .  aside from a heart-felt performance by john mcginley ,  and a fair job by charles dutton ,  do not bother with this one .  one small bit of trivia ,  there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured f . murray abraham ,  and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident . 
johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts .  minus the fangs ,  of course .  they're dark ,  bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery .  through their charms  ( namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet ,  respectively )  they seduce desperate souls ,  who they proceed to torment and victimize .  that's more or less the basis of this black comedy ,  as i understand it .   it's not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to ,  partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy ,  main character .  i did enjoy ,  however ,  the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire  ( and supposedly very witty )  remarks .  i was very impressed by the cast's strong acting ,  particularly david thelis's ;  only the character of jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional .  the photography and the music ,  both dramatic and somber ,  work very well together .    what really turns me off about  " naked "   ( and the main reason i'd never recommend it to anyone )  is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst .  in other words ,  in a world that sucks so bad ,  what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls ,  right ?  to suggest  ( as some have on this website )  that johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as jeremy ,  seems completely absurd to me .  they're both terrible ,  nasty people .  and they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance .  one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves ,  as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass .  but still ,  his and jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter .  and i could be wrong ,  but i'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical . 
just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick .  something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless ,  overwrought ,  convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing .  if the film is an attempt at social realism ,  these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent .  is it the acting ,  or the script that is bad ,  or both ?   the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical english literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated ?  and how is such an unattractive ,  unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them ?   ( i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street ,  despite his whining and self-pitying banter )  .   the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature ,  nostradamus and the book of revelations .  the impending doom of mankind ,  in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion ,  is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space .    this flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian  " philosophy "  about the meaning of mankind ,  life ,  etc .  it is trite ,  overwrought and tedious .   there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film .   " nil by mouth "  is an excellent ,  far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu .  ditto for  " in the warzone .  "  and although the comparison is not even warranted ,  check out anything by peter greenaway ,  who far more deftly handles dialogue ,  wit and absurd characters and situations . 
i really must watch a good movie soon ,  because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise .  however my history speaks ,  i must not tell a lie .  bobby deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels .  i never thought that i would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did .  al pacino isn't acting in this film :  he's posing .  there are many ,  many scenes of his character ,  who is a race car driver ,  just staring at the camera .  he's perfectly awful .  marthe keller is just as bad .  these two are supposed to be in a love affair ,  and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever .  sydney pollack directed this film ?  there's no trace of the genius behind tootsie here .  is this the same man i cheered for in eyes wide shut ?  i can hardly believe it .  save yourself a horrible movie experience .  run ,  don't walk ,  away from bobby deerfield . 
from beginning to end ,  this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen .  the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe kller's character are pure torture .  the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche ,  yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important .   maybe there's some value for a msft3000 re-playing of some of the scenes ,  such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female ,  for goof value .  but ,  even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey . 
the entire thing is very beautiful to look at .  . the european location shooting was a good idea .  the lead actors are attractive .  the score is servicable .   but then they spoke !  and the non-plot developed !  and it was all downhill from there .  pacino is sleepwalking and keller keeps talking about how bored she is .  . hello ,  dear ,  you're not alone .  when he does a mae west imitation ,  you might have to hide your face ,  its that painful to watch .   i can't imagine how either actor or director sydney pollack got involved with this ,  or a better question ,  why it ended up stinking so bad ?   since death is represented in almost every scene ,  one way or another ,  maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here .  maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death .  but i still can't recommend it . 
i made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome .  on paper ,  the script seems hopeful ,  and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes - i liked pacino in scent of a woman and have seen anny duperrey and marthe keller in several french and other films of the 70s/80s .  but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film ,  and in this film they are absolute  .  .  .  .  .  trash  !  the filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless ,  pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level .  in addition to that ,  i am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport .  even the inelegant dialogues in  " love story "  were better than the ones in this film  ( and that's saying something  !  !  )  .  i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much . 
one of the most peculiar oft-used romance movie plots is this one :  a seriously messed-up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman ,  who turns his life around before dying .  occasionally this story is done well and realistically  ( as in  " the theory of flight "  ,  an excellent weepie )  ,  but more frequently it's done like it is here ,  where as usual the heroine dies of  " old movie disease "  .  you know ,  the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you're telling your lover goodbye forever ;  and your looks aren't affected one bit  ( and since this is the 70's ,  neither is your sex life )  .  this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story ,  where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together ,  and they're played by actors who are completely at sea .   this has got to be the worst performance of al pacino's career ,  and i say that after having seen  " the devil's advocate "  only two days ago !  he plays a control-freak ,  emotionally constipated race-car driver ,  and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly .  he seems to constantly be asking himself why he's staying around the grating marthe keller  ( so does the audience )  ,  and spends most of the movie just .  .  .  standing there ,  usually with his mouth hanging open .  the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end ,  where his character proves that he's changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation .  hey ,  it *was* the seventies !   marthe keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest ;  her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying ,  and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of ,  say ,  vanessa redgrave or julie christie .  instead ,  they got the expressionless face and heavy german accent of ms .  keller ,  who comes across as more of a scary teutonic stereotype  (  " you vill eat ze omelet !  "  )  than anything like lovable .  she's supposed to be reforming pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that ,  but it doesn't work that way ,  it's more like she's harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion .  this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history ,  where you can't believe she'd be with someone she finds so worthless ,  and you can't believe he's with someone who gets on his nerves that much .   some bad-movie fans call this a cult classic ,  mostly because of pacino's silly  " liberating "  mae west imitation .  the scene is a scream ,  especially in context ,  but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for .  no ,  only see the film if you're a serious bad-movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors ,  or very bad casting  ( not only are the leads terrible ,  but pacino's other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes keller with shorter hair ,  i got them totally confused )  .  this isn't one of those laugh-a-minute bad movies like  " the conqueror "  ,  it's just a really ,  really bad movie .   
if utterly facile ,  regressive ,  self-indulgent ,  anti-establishment ,  anti-civilisation juvenilia appeals to you ,  then this is the ideal film .  very poorly scripted ,  with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout ,  this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic ,  manichean terms :  all adults  ( especially teachers ,  parents ,  priests and doctors )  are insensitive and bumbling at best ,  and predatory monsters at worst .  the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming  ( yawn )  and infantile regression  ( literally )  in a primitive cave-like space in the woods ,  with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again ,  in the woods  ( naturally .  .  .  )  .  displays all the weaknesses of a first film ,  and plenty more besides . 
cheap and manipulative .  this film has no heart .   it's also got dire dialogue ,  unconvincing characters and a preposterous ,  or rather non-existent ,  story .  it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest !   and the hedgehog !  !  !  ! how many cheap shots can a film take ?  the hedgehog ,  by the way ,  gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon .   if you have considered watching this film ,  don't .  i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie .  it scores a big ,  fat zero with me .  strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters .  yawneroony !   still ,  if you liked dancing in the dark .  .  .   
rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge .  while its clear why dawson took the role ,  its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent ,  decidedly un-hollywood film ,  its also clear that aside from stunning good looks ,  dawson seems out of place in the role .  forgive me i simply couldn't find her .  thats not a mistake ,  thats how i felt ,  i had no idea where she was .  yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever .  i blame the script for this since other than the ending ,  not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense .  the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together .  forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film ,  other than the end  ( which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it )  ,  and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image ,  stayed with me . what can i say ,  this may click with you ,  it may not ,  for me it's time i can't get back .  for rosario dawson fans only ,  though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17 .   ( and rosario- please ,  you're a better actress ,  pick better scripts ) 
my brother tom   aspect ratio :  1 . 85 : 1  sound format :  dolby digital  following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor ,  young jessica  ( jenna harrison )  forms a relationship with a strange boy  ( ben whishaw )  she meets in the woods .  unfortunately ,  whishaw has secrets of his own ,  no less troubling and far more dangerous .  .  .   dour drama ,  sparked by brave performances by harrison and whishaw ,  in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world' .  unfortunately ,  their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude ,  leading to an inevitable tragedy .  directed by dom rotheroe and photographed in digital video format ,  the movie looks ragged in places  ( too many awkward close-ups and sloppy hand-held camera moves )  and takes a while to find its feet ,  but the dramatic pay-off is quietly rewarding . 
amelia and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other .  amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him .  the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end .   there's not a whole lot to this particular short .  the direction is straight-forward and dramatic ,  which is good ,  the acting is sincere ,  but the story leaves a little bit to be desired .  why ,  exactly ,  do we care about these two people ?  it's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more pared down and doesn't search for meaning in it  ( a welcoming change of pace if anything )  .   i don't know ,  it's possible i don't connect to these stories because i've never experienced them .  but i have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same ,  i . e .  ,  a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines ,  etc .  the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different ,  and i'd like to see a different take .   --polarisdib
uta hagen's  " respect for acting "  is the standard textbook in many college theater courses .  in the book ,  hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor :  the presentational approach ,  and the representational approach .  in the presentational approach ,  the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible ,  by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life .  in the representational approach ,  the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion ,  through a high degree of control of movement and sound .   the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made .  british theater has a long history of this style of acting ,  and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school .   time has not been kind to this school of acting ,  or to this movie .  nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach .  to the modern eye ,  olivier's highly enunciated ,  stylized delivery is stodgy ,  stiff and stilted .  instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet ,  olivier made a declaiming ,  self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters ,  but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet .   and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today .  olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of hamlet's lines unintentionally funny :   " in-stead ,  you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it .  .  .  smooth-ness !  "  instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost  ( as any proper actor could )  ,  bright fill lights in olivier's pupils give us that impression .   eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet ,  putting in a good essay at the queen ,  despite the painfully obvious age differences  ( he was 41 ;  she was 26 )  .  the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done ,  given olivier's tendency to want to keep !  the camera !  on him !  at all !  times !    sixty years later ,  you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable ,  flawed hamlet ,  and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn .  final analysis :   " i would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing termagant ;  it out-herods herod :  pray you ,  avoid it .  " 
i love alec guinness .  and that's saying a lot after this film .  actually ,  he is not bad in it .  he just seems to stand aside ,  be urbane and his usual delightful self ,  but invest nada .  it is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight ,  even as an inexperienced young french girl .  sir alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now .   the interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd  " suzanne "  ,  another twit .   " donald "  aspires to be a french heathcliffe and i waited in vain for the source of his mystery .  what deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead ?  was he in love with the father's mistress ?  why did he jerk suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate ?  or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting .   the film would have been charming with guiness and the  " older woman "  reminiscing and seeing paris together .  that would have been a great story !  two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of world war ii .  why didn't somebody come up with that ?  i suggest watching alec guiness in  " the card "  ,  a little known but worthwhile film . 
in a recent biography of alec guinness i couldn't find too much about to paris with love .  i'm sure guinness did the film to get a free trip to paris out of it .  the film has no other reason for existence .   paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of guinness and his son driving down the champs elysee with the arc de triomphe in the background .  unfortunately it goes downhill from there .   there is just no chemistry at all between guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in paris .  according to the recent biography of guinness by piers paul read ,  guinness positively disliked the girl ,  found her conduct unprofessional .  as to what odile vernois thought of her co-star ,  no record is available .  they have as much chemistry as two neutered cats .   guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock .  but i wouldn't wait through the film for it .   at least alec got a trip to paris out of the deal . 
warning !  small plot details revealed !   i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film .  it is written so badly that every character is a caricature ,  yet it seems to take itself seriously .  it is poorly cast ,  especially ralph macchio  ( all baby-faced ,  5-foot-nothing of him )  as a streetwise tough .  plot elements are all drawn in black and white ,  with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax .   most egregious of all  ( plot element about to be revealed )  it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi-serious film .  one can just imagine the filmmakers saying ,   " we need jobeth to shed her top .  .  . hmmm .  .  . i've got it !  .  .  . early in the film ,  let's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways .  .  . then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway .  .  . yeah ,  that's the ticket !  "   i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 ,  one that proved all too weighty in the late 90's with events like columbine .  however ,  the execution is dreadful .  this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of  " heathers "  ,  a campy political statement like  " network "  or a serious examination like  " brubaker "  .  instead ,  it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things .   " teachers "  get an f . 
though i never like to be the sort of person who negates another's personal taste ;  if you like something ,  that's fine .  but ,  this movie was horrible and there is no way around it .  i don't like ani difranco too much ,  but she's a great guitarist and songwriter ,  that i can admit .  but i can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film .  many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face .  maybe ,  but everything is portrayed too far-fetched .  there seems to be an attempt at a  " naked gun "  - esque kind of comedy ,  but the timing is off ;  there is too much space between each actors line ,  as if they're holding for laughter  ( there wasn't any )  .  whoever wrote the script was all over the place .  they tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film ,  almost never fully developing any of them  ( especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher )  .  i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie .  i was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen . 
  this movie sucks .  ridiculous  " school "  athmosphere ,  unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the  " good teacher "  nick nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as kittens .   if this works for you ,  it doesn't for me .  0 out of 10
as an ex-teacher (  !  )  i must confess to cringing through many scenes - 'though i continued to watch to the end .  i wonder why ?  !   ( boredom ,  perhaps ?  )   : - )   the initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed .  the plot ,  too ,  although there were some good ideas - the plight of a relief teacher ,  for example - were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3-d development .   not one of mr nolte's finer moments .  as to young mr macchio ,  does he speak that way in *every* movie ?   plot and acting complaints aside ,  the hair-styles alone were a nostalgic  ( if nauseating )  trip .   
i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film .  i wasn't drawn in for even a second .  the characters were all one-dimensional .  they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick .  i would bet  ( and hope )  that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment .  there are some great actors here but you would never know it .  thank god it didn't destroy morgan freeman's or judd hirsh's or nick nolte's or laura dern's careers .  there was no vision ,  no labor of love here ,  only a horrible effort gone wrong .  btw i don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school . 
revenge is one of my favorite themes in film .  moreso ,   " the futility of revenge "  is one of my favorite themes in film .  having seen gaspar noe's irreversible  ( 2002 )  ,  i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme .  instead ,  this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus .   *spoilers* the end scene ,  a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene ,  came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy .  however ,  the film doesn't even follow through with this .  instead ,  the drawn out scene  ( which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized )  is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or  " this didn't fix anything "  while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background .   my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock ,  but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience .  i mean ,  do we feel bad for the rapist ?  do we rejoice in dawson's revenge ?  are we disgusted by the brutality of it all ?  do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity ?  aside from this failing ,  the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance .  character's are thin ,  dialog is monotonous ,  etc .   normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were .  thumbs down . 
people who actually liked problem child  ( 1990 )  need to have their heads examined .  who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny ?  the movie is not funny ,  ever ,  in any way ,  beginning to end .  it wants to be a cartoon ,  but the writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people get attacked by bears ,  or hit with baseball bats .  it may be funny in cartoons ,  but not in a motion picture .   the film's young hero is junior  ( michael oliver )  who ,  since he was a baby ,  has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption .  the families reject him ,  because junior tends to give them a hard time .   he is then thrown into an orphanage ,  where he terrorizes the nuns ,  and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow-tie killer  ( michael richards )  .  he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy  ( the late john ritter and his wife ,  amy yasbeck )  ,  who are dying to have a child ,  in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood .   junior becomes a member of the healy household ,  and  " little "  ben takes an interest in him ,  despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site ,  or throws a cat at his father  " big "  ben  ( jack warden )  ,  a bigoted politician .   i think that we're supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people .  his new mother ,  flo ,  is a bitch ,  his grandfather is completely selfish ,  and one little girl--who despises adopted kids--is such a spoiled brat .   but what junior does to get the last laughs isn't funny- -it's mean ,  cruel ,  and sometimes life-threatening .   and what is the film's message ?  that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism ?  that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers ?  they definitely don't what it's like to be a bad kid .  junior isn't a one--he's just a sadistic ,  little twerp .  there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others .  now ,  everybody's laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat .   it's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a  " family comedy .  "  what's worse is that problem child is rated pg .  what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this ?  there's a lot of profanity and mean-spirited pranks here ,  that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg-13 .   kids will enjoy this ,  but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen .  and to most people ,  problem child will be considered a  " guilty pleasure "  classic ;  a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking ,  even though the prevailing opinion ,  as put forth by more serious viewers ,  is that the movie is a piece of crap . 
i can't for the life of me remember why--i must have had a free ticket or something--but i saw this movie in the theater when it was released .  i don't remember who i went with ,  which theater i was in ,  or even which city .  all i remember was how offended i was at this travesty someone dared to call a film ,  and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over .  unfortunately i stuck it out to end ,  which i still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far .  my offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says  " look for problem child 2 ,  coming soon !  "  that was hands-down the most terrifying moment ever recorded on film .   the plot ,  if i recall correctly ,  involved john ritter and perhaps his wife  ( lord ,  how i've tried without success to block this film out of my mind )  adopting a  " problem child .  "  maybe they think they can reform him ,  or something .  i really don't know .  if that was their intent ,  they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest ,  rudest ,  most horrid demon-spawn ever to hit the big screen .  forget damian ,  forget rosemary's baby .  this kid takes the cake .  the only difference is ,  we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he's a  " problem child .  "  however ,  this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed .  you want to kill him through the entire film ,  and when  ( spoiler ,  like anyone cares )  john ritter decides to keep the vile hell-child you will be yelling  " send him back !  "  in shocked disgust  ( like several of the people at the theater where i saw it did )  .   this is only the second movie i have given a  " 1 "  to on the imdb .  the other was superman iv ,  and by god i couldn't tell you which was worse .  john ritter had a quote in tv guide about the time that problem child 3 ,  which he was not in ,  came out .  he said something like  " the only way i would do another [problem child] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform .  "  amen to that !   i would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of police academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of problem child again .  1/10 ,  only because i can't give it a negative score ,  which is what it really deserves .  someone burn the original negatives of this film ,  please ! 
problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade !  this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents ,  but he gets into trouble later .  that junior can drive grandpa's car .  he can scare people with a bear .  he can put a room on fire !  it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth .  a sequel is an even worse fate .  rent chicken run instead .   *1/2 out of **** i give it . 
 " problem child "  is one of the goofiest movies ever made .  it's not the worst  ( though some people will disagree with me on that )  ,  but it's not the best either .  it's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple  ( john ritter ,  amy yasbeck )  who foolishly adopts him .  this film is too silly and unbelievable because i don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film .  it's asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout  ( i really don't know why )  .  but i can't recommend this film .  i know i'm being too kind to it .  if there is one positive thing about  " problem child "  is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful .    **  ( out of four ) 
i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network .  there's just something about the ,  well ,  sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on .  yes ,  you're right about the sub-par acting ,  the plot which only an seven year old could like ,  etc .  but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors .  then again ,  a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel . 
i remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid ,  and there were parts of it  ( many in fact )  that i did not understand .  i think i have seen it once as an adult ,  and i then understood those parts .  the only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all .  so what kind of movie is this ?  is it a  " kids movie "  ?  not hardly .  it contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids .  is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children ?  maybe ,  but then why wouldn't it focus more on john ritter's character instead of junior ?  when a film has a 7-year-old as its main character ,  in order to do well with it's audience ,  it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd ,  otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate  ( even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them )  .  i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office ,  and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market . 
the first scene in 'problem child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face .  for this movie ,  that's witty .  a nasty ,  mean-spirited 'comedy' ,  it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief .  john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell ,  and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note ,  annoying performances and puerile humour .  and what the hell's jack warden doing in this mess ?  slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity ,  the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience .  but never mind all that .  the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver ,  the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me ,  you will want to smack him right in the mouth . 
this kid is rather bad ,  but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn .  no ,  he is not so much a brat ,  as he is a kid with severe emotional problems .  a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not .  through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there .  i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is .  even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one ,  and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too .  the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart ,  they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion .  add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort .  not sure about this character ,  at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something .  not all that good ,  but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week . 
my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was .  after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself .  it didn't .   i can't understand the praise given to this film .  the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time .   one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines .  i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness  ( like in happiness )  .  this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing .  this film might actually be much better with subtitles ,  and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film ,  because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much .   i generally like these types of small quirky films  ( the real blonde ,  walking and talking ,  lovely and amazing )  ,  but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years . 
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen !  i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time .  completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever .   steer clear . 
having just recently re-viewed  " lipstick "  for the first time in a few decades ,  i backed it with  " descent "  even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine .   it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years ,  from the full-on gore of  " i spit on your grave ,  "  to the tawdry sensationalism of  " lipstick ,  "  to the tasteful handling of the issue in  " the accused .  "  but  " descent ,  "  though making some important points ,  never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning .  no ,   " descent "  is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that ,  when examined closely ,  isn't that groundbreaking .   i pretty much knew the plot going in .  what i wanted to see *was* the  " descent "  or degeneration of dawson's character .  being a big fan of rosario's ,  i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted .  .  . you know ,  the kind of portrayal deniro brings to  " taxi driver .  "  unfortunately ,  the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition .   the biggest point of failure is the second act .  it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping ,  drug use ,  and obsession with big black stallion adrian  ( every white boy's nightmare ,  natch )  from a q&a on the dvd ,  but this excursion into dawson's character is never believably rendered .  we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time ,  what she's after ,  or why she's doing it .  the poor quality of the audio/video again don't help ,  but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless .  it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act .  by the time we get to the finale ,  our interest has already waned .   one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end  " revenge "  scene we are pumped for retribution ,  then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is .  while that's certainly valid ,  it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing .   if you have the dvd ,  check out the deleted  " classroom "  scene .  this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation  ( though all verbal )  and really does show dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy ,  condescending dorm counselor .  if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down ,  we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence .   as the film stands in the final cut ,  though ,  all we get is what we've seen before ,  only in a more graphic rendering .  so what ? 
don't waste 90 minutes of your time on  " fast food ,  fast women .  "  it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing ,  horrific acting ,  and even bad music .  i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen .  she needs the fast food .   spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting .  .  . like trimming your toenails .  you'd have more entertainment value .   the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser ,  but she deserves much better than this tired script .  it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie .   viewer beware ! 
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery .  it fails badly at both .  the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie .  the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it .  could there be two movies with the same name ?  the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there .   
story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while .  all the action is in the end ,  but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny ,  but because the story is pathetic .   the funniest part is when harvey 'i'm not paranoia' keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre .  oscars for this guy ! 
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven't got the hang of farce .  even when it has already been written for them !  the original film  " hodet over vannet "  is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8/10 .  it isn't just about a linguistic translation ,  but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely ,  robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap  " oops there go my trousers "  style of farce . 
it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv .  they said it was a comedy !  the movie started ,  10 minutes passed ,  after that 30 minutes and i didn't laugh not even once .  the fact is that the movie ended and i didn't get even on echance to laugh .  please ,  someone tickle me ,  i lost 90 minutes for nothing . 
have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept ?  i can think of plenty that equal this one ,  but none which manage to outdo it .  the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue .  i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this .  each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot ,  but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career .  even the many charms of ms .  diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this .  avoid ,  it's obviously a style of film that americans haven't really got a grasp of .  watch the final result if you must ,  and you'll see what i'm talking about ,  but don't say i didn't warn you .  .  . 
the next time you are at a party and someone asks ,   " the other day i heard the expression 'author's will' .  does anyone know what it means ?  "  tell them to sit through 'head above water' .  the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers .  there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs .  however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis .  why does keitel tie diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind ?  why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course .  for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop . 
turgid dialogue ,  feeble characterization - harvey keitel a judge ?  he plays more like an off-duty hitman - and a tension-free plot conspire to make one of the unfunniest films of all time .  you feel sorry for the cast as they try to extract comedy from a dire and lifeless script .  avoid ! 
cameron diaz is a woman who is married to a judge ,  played by harvey keitel ,  whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated .  .  while i was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why i was doing so .  . because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability .  nor does the audience really car what happens .  . even the lovely cameron can't save this one on a scale of one to ten .  . 2
i had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on sky cinema max in a cold winter night .  i am not a big fan of horror movies ,  because most of them are just trash .  this one is even worse :  it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life .  horror movie ?  yes ,  there are horrible things in this :  the acting ,  the script and the special effects - gosh ,  i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes .  actually ,  had it been a comic movie i would've given it a 5 .  don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers .   vote :  2 out of 10 - didn't vote one because it made me laugh all the time  ; - ) 
it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself .  the paragraph-long  " plot summary "  written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie .  i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the  ( bleep )  was going on .  alas ,  to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story ,  if you could call it a story .  it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here ,  filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations .  newsflash to the the creators :  i paid to watch you make a movie .  i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free .  and rosario dawson ?  this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face ,  and i can see why .  she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie ,  a or b .  i figured okay ,  maybe she didn't really want the role ,  just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into ?  wrong .  she was listed as one of the producers .  next time you produce something ,  don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act .  if you really can ,  then create a decent character for you to become .  also ,  somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes ,  i hate to say it ,  but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats .  that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters .  the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist .  as for the maya character ,  she didn't seem like a real person .  anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made . 
having watched this movie on the scifi channel ,  i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives .  the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences ,  or  " delights "  as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me .  the plot isn't really worth commenting as ,  but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory .  before the movie is over ,  we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out ,  yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters ,  yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them ,  a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin ,  a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm ,  a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe ,  yet then jumps off ,  and a whole collection of further ,  bizarre occurrences .  basically ,  if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies ,  avoid this film like the plague .  or as my friend reading over my shoulder says :   " it's the best movie i have ever seen .  "  to which the friend on my right says :   " only battle techno music could have made it better .  " 
first off ,  i'm not here to dog this movie .  i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality .  the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them ,  although the monster itself is quite well done .  .  . impressively well done ,  at that .  he actually looks kind of other-worldly ,  like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a  .  .  .  attending to nature's call ,  spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down .  that ,  or he's the caucasian brother of the wishmaster .  i haven't decided which .   actually ,  this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country ,  yes ,  but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere .  the trees and vistas say canada to me ,  and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber-coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china .  it's a sci-fi channel movie ,  so we can forgive the lack of location .   further ,  apparently  ( as we have just established )  sci-fi directors do not travel often ,  as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened .  but as i said ,  it's a sci-fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things .   the movie is pretty graphic at times ,  and rotates between  " alive "  about the donner party ,   " predator "  about the alien in the woods ,  and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires .  the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman .  .  . or super mario .  .  . remember ?   " run faster !  jump higher !  live longer !  "    also ,  the yeti has missed his teddy bear .  he's searched high and low for it ,  but cannot seem to make a cadaver work .  poor yeti !  you can't help but feel sorry for it .  it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss .  he's missed his bear .  or maybe it wants to mate ,  but that thought is banished !  do ya hear me ?  well ,  it does seem to be an unmated male .  rebanished !    and it's superhuman .  well ,  it's not human .  .  . it's super-yeti !  but then again ,  what's normal-yeti ?  i don't know ,  but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling .  and he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur .  fabulous dahlink !  it's spotlessly white at times when it so shouldn't be .  he's fastidiously superhu- .  .  . super-yeti .   all in all ?  this was a lot of fun to watch ,  has some great kills and a few honest plot elements .  in spite of the horribly gravel-like production style ,  this is actually quite entertaining .  i can't help wondering if they're planning on another one ?    it rates a 6 . 0/10 on the m4tv scale .   it rates a 4 . 4/10 on the movie scale from .  .  .   the fiend  :  . 
ah yez ,  the sci fi channel produces yeti another abominable movie .  i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where ,  as the survivors desperately searched for matches ,  at least a half dozen fires burned  with no apparent reason  at various points of the wreckage .  fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout .  they searched corpses for lighters and matches ,  and finally finding a box built a fire every day for ,  apparently ,  12 ,  but no one ever gathered wood .  then when the vegan  ( hah )  burned the bodies ,  what did she use for an accelerant ?  i mean these guys were frozen  well maybe not .  despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate ,  bled .  maybe it's just me ,  but even in a totally unbelievable tale  ( none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti ,  or an abominable snowman ,  until the very end )  ,  if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable .  oh ,  what did the prologue  ( 1972 )  have to do with the remainder of the movie ?  and the revolver ,  warm enough to hold in his hand ,  froze up and wouldn't fire .  gimme a break .  well ,  at least we have carly pope ,  another eminently lovely canadian lass .  and ,  with little irony ,  ed marinaro as the coach .   well i might as well add ,  the rabbit they ate  ( despite it looking like chicken )  is not a rodent ,  but a lagomorph .  now if it had been a squirrel  ( or a rat )  it would have been a rodent ,  but it still looked like chicken .  and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note  " it tastes just like .  .  .  " 
yeti :  curse of the snow demon starts aboard a plane full of american high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in japan ,  unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the himalayas .  unlucky really .  with some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes .  however just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge ,  hairy yeti type abominable snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all .  trapped ,  cold ,  starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time ?   yeah ,  with a title like yeti :  curse of the snow demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the sci-fi channel has made yet another 'creature feature' although to give these things a bit of variety the sci-fi channel here in the uk are now dubbing them as a 'beast feast' !  as if that will make any difference .  directed by paul ziller one has to say that yeti :  curse of the snow deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time ,  sure it's bad but it's sort of fun at times too .  the basic premise is alright actually ,  it's a sort of cross between alive  ( 1993 )  with it's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer bigfoot  ( another legendary hairy monster )  exploitation flick night of the demon  ( 1980 )  which i would defend with my last breath & i have to say it's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as i said it's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written .  the character's are mostly annoying american teens ,  there's the expected arguing ,  there's the macho hero ,  the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there's no prizes for originality .  there are some plot holes too ,  if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ?  how are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ?  why did the yeti not kill that bird at the end ?  it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ?  the 'there are actually two yeti's running around' twist isn't used to any effect at all either .  at least there's a good pace about the film ,  it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & i never found myself becoming bored with it .  there's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not .   the one thing you can always say about these sci-fi channel 'creature features' or 'beast feasts' is that the cgi computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again .  the plane crash at the start looks awful & the yeti when it's cgi looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it's on a pogo stick .  there one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm ,  a squashed head ,  a ripped out heart ,  some dead bodies ,  some blood splatter & the best bit when the yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them .  according to the imdb the actor playing the yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it's actually a pretty tatty looking creation .  apparently the original title was raksha :  curse of the snow demon with raksha meaning demon in tibetan sanskrit ,  so now you know .   this has reasonable production values considering the usual sci-fi channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh ,  bleak himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm .  the acting isn't that good & i didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help .   yeti :  curse of the snow demon is another terrible sc-fi channel 'creature feature' if i am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it's not very good . 
hmmm ,  a sports team is in a plane crash ,  gets stranded on a snowy mountain ,  and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive .  sound familiar anyone ?  i refer to  " alive "  from 1993 .  the only major difference here ,  of course ,  is that a big ,  white ,  drunken scare crow of a yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead .  i guess humans taste better than yaks .   stupid :  the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the yeti ,  nor does he have a backup .   the plane crash is completely bogus .  it would have either exploded in the air ,  exploded when it hit the ground ,  or become obliterated .  the people would not have survived ,  but hey ,  it's sci-fi .   stupid :  they survived ,  and they are cold .  it might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death .  fire being warm as it is .  .  .   wtf :  the pilot has frost formed all over his face while he's alive and talking ,  but oddly enough ,  no one else does .   stupid :  one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters ,  but there are scattered parts of the plane on fire all around them .   stupid :  they find coats and hoodies ,  and yet there in the cold of the himalayas ,  they fail to use the hoods !   stupid :  they're staring at a pile of sticks when ,  i reiterate ,  there are pieces of the plane already burning .   stupid :  the himalayas are notorious for its storms .  it would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering .  there are a lot of pine trees around ,  the branches of which make excellent insulation .   wtf :  when in doubt ,  use a dead man's arm as a splint .   wtf :  if the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels ,  bears ,  and leopards in the himalayas ,  then why doesn't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start ?    stupid :  when attempting to trap wild animals ,  mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helps .   wtf :  do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass ?  !    wtf :  the group was ready and armed to fight the yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless .  the yeti ripped out the guy's heart and stomped the girl's head ,  and the gang did nothing .  there's love .   so two yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever .  .  .  .  or so we think .  mwuhahahaa !  the story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes ,  as usual .  nice thinking with the javelin and the chain ,  although this is some ingenuity  ( with the magically-appearing chain )  that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they couldn't even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them .   as is typical for the sci-fi originals ,  the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them  ( not to mention they ate human flesh and haven't brushed their teeth in several days )  .   the very end ,  however ,  is quote lame . 
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night ,  and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic .  it was awful in every way .  how badly did jack lemmon ,  james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie ? 
although the production and jerry jameson's direction are definite improvements ,   " airport '77 "  isn't much better than  " airport 1975 "  :  slick ,  commercial rubbish submerging  ( this time literally )  a decent cast .  jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea  ( all the publicity claimed it was near the bermuda triangle ,  but there's no mention of it in the film itself )  .  when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water ,  we see all their cranes dropping  ( rather blindly )  into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh  ( imagining the cranes plugging the plane ,  the passengers and the waterlogged script )  .  nbc used to air what appeared to be the  " director's cut "  ,  with at least an hour of extra footage--mostly flashbacks--injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a  " gilligan's island "  episode .  most exciting moment is the plane crash ,  and some of the players have a little fun :  lee grant is an obnoxious drunk ,  brenda vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess ,  joseph cotten and olivia de havilland are flirting oldsters .  still ,  the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one's patience .  ** from ****
capt .  gallagher  ( lemmon )  and flight attendant eve clayton  ( vaccaro )  are a supposedly hot item in this death trip ;  a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub-slash-hotel there's even a blind piano player who falls in love .  karen wallace  ( grant )  is the hysterical b ! $3& who'll do anything to get attention from henpecked husband martin  ( christopher lee )  and ,  later ,  the rest of the people on board .   memorable moments :  boeing 747 doing a belly flop in the atlantic ocean ,  karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far ,  and furniture  ( and screaming people )  who become 'ball bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine . '  the action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal ,  but not much goes on in between .  hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel ,  but i forget the reason why not he would've done wonders for the 1970 original ,  on which this sequel is partly inspired  ( '77 also got inspiration from `the flight of the phoenix' )  .    actors cotten and de havilland reunite from their days on `hush ,  hush ,  sweet charlotte'  ( apparently here they are not playing heavies ,  just reunited autumn years' lovers )  .  and isn't the actress playing emily's companion the same one who played the hammered-to-death maid on `whatever happened to baby jane ? '  tv actors include the girlfriend from `mayberry rfd'  ( her character's daughter wins a drawing contest ,  or something lame like that )  ,  `buck rogers' gil gerard and `dynasty's' pamela bellwood .   
towards the end of the movie ,  i felt it was too technical .  i felt like i was in a classroom watching how our navy performs rescues at sea .  i liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers .  i guess i should have figured that out before ,  but i never thought about it .  using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic .  the acting was pretty good ,  since they're mostly seasoned professionals ,  but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen ,  it should be more like a fantasy ,  comical ,  etc .  everything was taken too seriously .  at least the movie had felix ungar as pilot ,  with buck rogers ,  the night stalker ,  and dracula also on board .  the movie was filled with well known faces .  i understand that hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama ,  but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature .  that's why i said it should have been more comical .  my pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about .  they walk around with drinks ,  setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later ,  just as if they're in a building or something ,  and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist .  also ,  i know it's a disaster movie ,  but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something .  anyway ,  the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening .  i like lee grant ,  but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked .  .  .  :  ) 
this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time ,  but it's not bloody true .  i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it's as bad as i first thought it was .   some kind of mobsters hijack a boeing 747 .   ( that ,  at least ,  is an improvement over having boeing hijack a good part of the pentagon .  )  the airplane goes down in the bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms ,  a kind of post-facto submarine .   it has one of those all-star casts ,  the stars either falling or barely above the horizon .    " we're on our own !  "  ,  says pilot jack lemon .  he is so right .  except for george kennedy .  he's in all these disaster movies .   watch another movie instead .  oh ,  not  " airport "  the original .  that's no good either .  instead ,  watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like  " flight of the phoenix .  " 
i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment .  disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful ,  the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and ,  being a fan  ( sounds pervy ,  i'm not !  )  of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's ,  i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out .  my conclusion :  let's stick to the classics !  yes ,  the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat ,  the actors unconvincing .  even dawson is empty .  some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us ,  that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial .  just like the scene where dawson gets raped :  it seriously lacks intensity !  i wasn't expecting anything 'irreversible'-style but still ,  aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her ?  i didn't .  not for a minute ,  she was so lame all the way  ; - )  and i read that the photography was impressive .  well ,  it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either .  i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie ,  i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again .  lol .  more seriously ,  the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me' .  .  .  the crude red and blue lighting ,  the heavy bass music ,  the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere .  .  .  no ,  i just couldn't get into this movie .  too bad . 
some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great ,  but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others ,  the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles .   the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh .  other than that ,  its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk .   it's been noted elsewhere ,  but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence ,  so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks ,  you've seen it all already .   bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 , 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast  ( especially the hitchhiker ,  who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit )  ,  and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip .   awful ,  awful stuff .  we've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera ,  but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere .  avoid . 
this is one of the dumbest films ,  i've ever seen .  it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all .   there's not a single good line or character in the whole mess .  if there was a plot ,  it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes ,  there's nothing good to say so ill say nothing .  i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released ,  does somebody somewhere not at some stage think ,  'oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day .  its crap like this that has people downloading illegally ,  the trailer looks like a completely different film ,  at least if you have download it ,  you haven't wasted your time or money don't waste your time ,  this is painful .
